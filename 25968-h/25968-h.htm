INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The purpose of this book is to instruct the prospective
newspaper reporter in the way to write those
stories which his future paper will call upon him to
write, and to help the young cub reporter and the
struggling correspondent past the perils of the copyreader's
pencil by telling them how to write clean
copy that requires a minimum of editing. It is not
concerned with the <em>why</em> of the newspaper business&mdash;the
editor may attend to that&mdash;but with the <em>how</em>
of the reporter's work. And an ability to write is
believed to be the reporter's chief asset. There is
no space in this book to dilate upon newspaper organization,
the work of the business office, the writing
of advertisements, the principles of editorial
writing, or the how and why of newspaper policy
and practice, as it is. These things do not concern
the reporter during the first few months of his work,
and he will learn them from experience when he
needs them. Until then, his usefulness depends
solely upon his ability to get news and to write it.</p>

<p>There are two phases of the work which every
reporter must learn: how to get the news and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to write it. The first he can pick up easily by actual
newspaper experience&mdash;if nature has endowed him
with "a nose for news." The writing of the news
he can learn only by hard practice&mdash;a year's hard
practice on some papers&mdash;and it is generally conceded
that practice in writing news stories can be
secured at home or in the classroom as effectively as
practice in writing short stories, plays, business letters,
or any other special form of composition.
Newspaper experience may aid the reporter in learning
how to write his stories, but a newspaper apprenticeship
is not absolutely necessary. However,
whether he is studying the trade of newspaper writing
in his home, in a classroom, or in the city room
of a daily paper, he needs positive instruction in the
English composition of the newspaper office&mdash;rather
than haphazard criticism and a deluge of "don'ts."
Hence this book is concerned primarily with the
writing of the news.</p>

<p>Successful newspaper reporting requires both an
ability to write good English and an ability to write
good English in the conventional newspaper form.
And there is a conventional form for every kind of
newspaper story. Many editors of the present day
are trying to break away from the conventional form
and to evolve a looser and more natural method of
writing news stories. The results are often bizarre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
and sometimes very effective. Certainly originality
in expression adds much to the interest of newspaper
stories, and many a good piece of news is
ruined by a bald, dry recital of facts. Just as the
good reporter is always one who can give his yarns
a distinctive flavor, great newspaper stories are seldom
written under the restriction of rules. But no
young reporter can hope to attain success through
originality and defiance of rules until he has first
mastered the fundamental principles of newspaper
writing. He can never expect to write "the story
of the year" until he has learned to handle everyday
news without burying the gist of his stories&mdash;any
more than an artist can hope to paint a living portrait
until he has learned, with the aid of rules, to
draw the face of a plaster block-head. Hence the
emphasis upon form and system in this book. And,
whatever the form may be, the embodiment must be
clear, concise, grammatical English; that is the excuse
for the many axioms of simple English grammar
that are introduced side by side with the study
of the newspaper form.</p>

<p>The author offers this book as the result of personal
newspaper experience and of his work as instructor
in classes in newspaper writing at the University
of Wisconsin. Every item that is offered
is the result of an attempt to correct the mistakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
that have appeared most often in the papers of students
who are trying to do newspaper writing in
the classroom. The seemingly disproportionate emphasis
upon certain branches of the subject and the
constant repetition of certain simple principles are
to be excused by the purpose of the book&mdash;to be a
text-book in the course of study worked out in this
school of journalism. The use of the fire story as
typical of all newspaper stories and as a model for
all newspaper writing is characteristic of this method
of instruction. Four chapters are devoted to the
explanation of a single principle which any reader
could grasp in a moment, because experience has
shown that an equivalent of four chapters of study
and practice is required to teach the student the application
of this principle and to fix it in his mind
so thoroughly that he will not forget it in his later
work of writing more complicated stories. It is
felt that the beginner needs and must have the detailed
explanation, the constant reiteration and some
definite rules to guide him in his practice. Hence
the emphasis upon the conventional form. Since,
in the application of the newspaper principle of beginning
with the gist of the story, the structure of
the lead is of greater importance than the rest of the
story, this book devotes the greater part of its discussion
to the lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
The suggestions for practice are attached in an
attempt to give the young newspaper man some
<em>positive</em> instruction. Most reporters are instructed
by a system of "don'ts," growled out by busy editors;
most correspondents receive no instruction at
all&mdash;a positive suggestion now and then cannot but
help them both. Practice is necessary in the study of
any form of writing; these suggestions for practice
embody the method of practice used in this school
of journalism. The examples are taken from representative
papers of the entire country to show the
student how the stories are actually written in newspaper
offices.</p>

NEWSPAPER REPORTING<br />
AND CORRESPONDENCE</h1>

<h2><a name="i" id="i"></a>I<br />
<br />
<small>GATHERING THE NEWS</small></h2>


<p>Unlike almost any other profession, that of a
newspaper reporter combines two very different activities&mdash;the
gathering of news and the writing of
news. Part of the work must be done in the office
and part of it outside on the street. At his desk in
the office a reporter is engaged in the literary, or
pseudo-literary, occupation of writing news stories;
outside on the street he is a detective gathering news
and hunting for elusive facts to be combined later
into stories. Although the two activities are closely
related, each requires a different sort of ability and
a different training. In a newspaper office the two
activities are rarely separated, but a beginner must
learn each duty independent of the other. This
book will not attempt to deal with both; it will confine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
itself mainly to one phase, the pseudo-literary
activity of writing news stories.</p>

<p>However, introductory to the discussion of the
writing of newspaper stories, we may glance at the
other side of the newspaper writer's work&mdash;the
gathering of the news. Where the newspaper gets its
news and how it gets its news can be learned only
by experience, for it differs in different cities and
with different papers. But an outline of the background
of news-gathering may assist us in writing
the news after it is gathered and ready for us to
write.</p>

<p><b>1. Reporter vs. Correspondent.</b>&mdash;There are two capacities
in which one may write news stories for a
paper. He may work on the staff as a regular reporter
or he may supply news from a distance as a
correspondent. In the one case he works under the
personal supervision of a city editor and spends his
entire time at the regular occupation of gathering
and writing news. As a correspondent he works in
a distant city, under the indirect supervision of the
city, telegraph, or state editor, and sends in only the
occasional stories that seem to be of interest to his
paper. In either case the same rules apply to his
news gathering and to his news writing. And in
either case the length of his employment depends
upon his ability to turn in clean copy in the form in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which his paper wishes to print the news. Both the
reporter and the correspondent must write their
stories in the same form and must look at news and
the sources of news from almost the same point of
view. Whatever is said of the reporter applies
equally to the correspondent.</p>

<p><b>2. Expected and Unexpected News.</b>&mdash;The daily
news may be divided into two classes from the newspaper's
point of view: expected and unexpected
news. Expected news includes all stories of which
the paper has a previous knowledge. Into this class
fall all meetings, speeches, sermons, elections, athletic
contests, social events, and daily happenings
that do not come unexpectedly. They are the events
that are announced beforehand and tipped off to the
paper in time for the editor to send out a reporter
to cover them personally. These events are of
course recorded in the office, and each day the editor
has a certain number of them, a certain amount of
news that he is sure of. Each day he looks over his
book to note the events that are to take place during
that day and sends out his reporters to cover them.</p>

<p>The other class includes the stories that break unexpectedly.
Accidents, deaths, fires, storms, and
other unexpected happenings come without warning
and the reporting of them cannot be arranged for
in advance. These are the stories that the paper is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
most anxious to get and the things for which the
whole staff always has its eyes and ears open. Seldom
are they heard of in time for the paper to have
them covered personally, and the reporting of such
stories becomes a separate sort of work&mdash;the gathering
and sorting of the facts that can be obtained
only from chance witnesses.</p>

<p><b>3. News Sources.</b>&mdash;There are certain sources from
which the paper gets most of its tips of expected
events and its knowledge of unexpected events.
These every editor knows about. The courts, the
public records, the public offices, the churches, and
the schools furnish a great many of the tips of expected
news. The police stations, the fire stations,
the hospitals, and the morgues furnish most of the
tips of unexpected news. Whenever an event is going
to happen, or whenever an unexpected occurrence
does happen, a notice of it is to be found in
some one of these sources. Such a notice or a casual
word from any one is called a "tip" and indicates
the possibility of securing a story. The securing of
the story is another matter. A would-be reporter
may get good practice from studying the stories in
the daily papers and trying to discover or imagine
from what source the original news tip came. He
will soon find that certain classes of stories always
come from certain sources and that there is a perceptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
amount of routine evident in the accounts of
the most unexpected occurrences.</p>

<p><b>4. Runs and Assignments.</b>&mdash;Between the news tip
and the finished copy for the compositor there is a
vast amount of news gathering, which falls to the
lot of the reporter. This is handled by a system of
runs and special assignments. A reporter usually
has his own run, or beat, on which he gathers news.
His run may cover a certain number of police stations
or the city hall or any group of regular news
sources. Each day he must visit the various sources
of news on his beat and gather the tips and whatever
facts about the stories behind the tips that he can.
The tips that he secures furnish him with clues to
the stories, and it is his business to get the facts
behind all of the tips on his beat and to write them
up, unless a tip opens up a story that is too big for
him to handle alone without neglecting his beat.</p>

<p>Assignments are used to cover the stories that do
not come in through the regular sources, and to handle
the big stories that are unearthed on the regular
beats. The editor turns over to the reporter the tip
that he has received and instructs him to go out and
get the facts. A paper's best reporters are used almost
entirely on assignments, and when they go out
after a story they practically become detectives.
They follow every clue that the tip suggests and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
every clue that is opened up as they progress; they
hunt down the facts until they are reasonably sure
that they have secured the whole story. The result
may not be worth writing, or it may be worth a
place on the front page, but the reporter must get
to the bottom of it. Whether on a beat or on an
assignment every reporter must have his ears open
for a tip of some unexpected story and must secure
the facts or inform the editor at once. It is in this
way that a paper gets a scoop, or beat, on its rivals
by printing a story before the other papers have
heard of it.</p>

<p><b>5. Interviews for Facts.</b>&mdash;To cover an assignment
and secure the facts of a story is not at all easy. If
the reporter could be a personal witness of the happening
which he is to report, the task would be simpler.
But, outside the case of expected events, he
rarely hears of the occurrence until after it is past
and the excitement has subsided. Then he must
find the persons who witnessed the occurrence or
who know the facts, and get the story from them.
Perhaps he has to see a dozen people to get the information
he wants. Getting facts from people in
this way is called interviewing&mdash;interviewing for
facts, as distinguished from formal interviewing for
the purpose of securing a statement or an opinion
that is to be printed with the name of the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
utters it. Although a dozen interviews may be
necessary for a single story, not one of them is mentioned
in the story, for they are of no importance
except in the facts that they supply.</p>

<p>For example, suppose a reporter is sent out to get
the story of a fire that has started an hour or two
before he goes on duty. All that his editor gives
him is the tip from the fire department, or from
some other source, of a fire at such-and-such an address.
When he arrives at the scene there is nothing
left but smoldering ruins with perhaps an engine
throwing a stream on the smoking d&eacute;bris and a few
by-standers still loitering about. He can see with
his own eyes what kind of building has burned, and
how completely it has been destroyed. A by-stander
may be able to tell him who occupied the building or
what it was used for, but he must hunt for some one
else who can give him the exact facts that his paper
wants. Perhaps he can find the tenant and learn
from him what his loss has been. The tenant can
give him the name of the owner and may be able to
tell him something about the origin of the fire. He
must find the owner to get the value of the building
and the amount of insurance carried. Perhaps he
cannot find any of these people and must ask the
fire chief or some one else to give him what facts
and estimates he can. If the fire is at all serious he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
must find out who was killed or injured and get
their names and addresses and the nature of their
injury or the manner of their death. Perhaps he
can talk to some of the people who had narrow escapes,
or interview the friends or relatives of the
dead. Everywhere he turns new clues open up, and
he must follow each one of them in turn until he is
sure that he has all the facts.</p>

<p><b>6. Point of View.</b>&mdash;The task would be easy if
every one could tell the reporter just the facts that
his paper wants. But in the confusion every one
is excited and fairly bubbling over with rumors and
guesses which may later turn out to be false. Each
person who is interested in the incident sees and tells
it only from his own point of view. Obviously the
reporter's paper does not want the facts from many
different points of view, nor even from the point of
view of the fire department, of the owner, or of the
woman who was rescued from the third floor. The
paper wants the story from a single point of view&mdash;the
point of view of an uninterested spectator. Consequently
the reporter must get the facts through
interviews with a dozen different people, discount
possible exaggeration and falsity due to excitement,
make allowances for the different points of view,
harmonize conflicting statements, and sift from the
mass what seems to him to be the truth. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
must write the story from the uninterested point of
view of the public, which wants to hear the exact
facts of the fire told in an unprejudiced way. Never
does the story mention any of the interviews behind
it except when the reporter is afraid of some statement
and wants to put the responsibility upon the
person who gave it to him. And so the finished
story that we read in the next morning's paper is
the composite story of the fire chief, the owner, the
tenant, the man who discovered the fire, the widow
who was driven from her little flat, the little girl
who was carried down a ladder through the smoke,
the man who lost everything he had in the world,
and the cynic who watched the flames from behind
the fireline&mdash;all massed together and sifted and retold
in an impersonal way from the point of view of
a by-stander who has been everywhere through the
flames and has kept his brain free from the terror
and excitement of it all.</p>

<p>The same is true of every story that is printed in
a newspaper. Every story must be secured in the
same way&mdash;whether it is the account of a business
transaction, a bank robbery, a political scandal, a
murder, a reception, or a railroad wreck. Seldom
is it possible to find any one person who knows all
the facts just as the newspaper wants them, and
many a story that is worth but a stickful in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
edition is the result of two hours' running about
town, half a dozen telephone calls, and a dozen interviews.
That is the way the news is gathered,
and that is the part of the reporter's work that he
must learn by experience. But after all the gathering
is finished and he has the facts, the writing of
the story remains. If the reporter knows how to
write the facts when he has them, his troubles are
cut in half, for nowadays a reporter who writes well
is considered a more valuable asset than one who
cannot write and simply has a nose for news.</p>

<p><b>7. News-Gathering Agencies.</b>&mdash;This account of
news gathering is of course told from the point of
view of the reporter. Naturally it assumes a different
aspect in the editor's eyes. Much of the day's
news does not have to be gathered at all. A steady
stream of news flows in ready for use from the
great news-gathering agencies, the Associated Press,
the United Press, the City Press, etc., and from correspondents.
Many stories are merely summaries
of speeches, bulletins, announcements, pamphlets
and other printed matter that comes to the editorial
office, and many stories come already written. Almost
everybody is looking for publicity in these days
and the editor does not always have to hunt the
news with an army of ferrets. Co&ouml;peration in news
gathering has simplified the whole matter. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
all has to be written and edited. That is why great
reporters are no longer praised for their cleverness
in worming their way to elusive facts, but for their
ability to write a good story. That is why we no
longer hear so much about beats and scoops but
more about clean copy and "literary masterpieces."</p>

<p><b>8. How the Correspondent Works.</b>&mdash;The correspondent
gathers news very much as the reporter
does, but he does it without the help of a city editor.
He must be his own director and keep his own book
of tips, for he has no one to make out his assignments
beforehand. He has to watch for what news
he can get by himself and send it to his paper of
his own accord, except occasionally when his paper
instructs him to cover a particularly large story.
But he gets his tips and runs down his facts just as
a reporter does. Just as much alertness and just as
much ability to write are required of him.</p>

<p>The correspondent's work is made more difficult
by what is called news values. Distance affects the
importance of the facts that he secures and the
length of the stories he writes. He must weigh
every event for its interest to readers a hundred or
a thousand miles away. What may be of immense
importance in his community may have no interest
at all for readers outside that community. He must
see everything with the eyes of a stranger, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
must influence his whole work of news gathering
and news writing. This matter will be taken up at
greater length in the next chapter.</p>

<p><b>9. Correspondent's Relation to His Paper.</b>&mdash;The relations
of a correspondent to the paper or news association
to which he is sending news can best be
learned by experience. Every paper has different
rules for its correspondents and different directions
in regard to the sort of news it wants. The rules
regarding the mailing of copy and the sending of
stories or queries by telegraph are usually sent out
in printed form by each individual paper to its correspondents.
But while gathering news and writing
stories for a distant paper, a correspondent must always
regard himself as a reporter and write his
stories in the form in which they are to appear in
print if he wishes to remain correspondent for any
length of time. The following rules are taken from
the "<span class="smcap">instructions to correspondents</span>" sent out
on a printed card to the correspondents of the St.
Louis <em>Star</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>QUERY BY WIRE ON ALL STORIES you consider are
worth telegraphing, unless you are absolutely certain <em>The
Star</em> wants you to send the story without query, or in case
of a big story breaking suddenly near edition time. If you
have not time to query, get a reply and send such matter as
might be ordered before the next edition time; send the story
in the shortest possible number of words necessary to tell it,
asking if additional matter is desired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Write your queries so they can be understood. Never send
a "blind" query. If John Smith, a confirmed bachelor, whose
age is 80 years, elopes with and marries the daughter of the
woman who jilted him when he was a youth, say so in as few
words as possible, but be sure to convey the dramatic news
worth of the story in your query. Do not say, "Bachelor
elopes with girl, daughter of woman he knew a long time
ago." In itself the story which this query tells might be worth
printing, but it would not be half so good a story as the
elopement of John Smith, 80, bachelor, woman hater, with the
daughter of his old sweetheart.</p>

<p>When a good story breaks close to edition time and the
circumstances justify it, use the long-distance telephone, but
first be reasonably certain <em>The Star</em> will not get the story from
another source.</p>

<p>Write your stories briefly. <em>The Star</em> desires to remunerate
its correspondents according to the worth of a story and not
for so many words. One good story of 200 words with the
right "punch" in the introduction is worth a dozen strung
over as many dozen pages of copy paper with the real story
in the last paragraph of each. Tell your story in simple,
every-day conversational words: quit when you have finished.
Relegate the details. Unless it is a case of identification in a
murder mystery, or some similar big story, no one cares about
the color of the man's hair. Get the principal facts in the
first paragraph&mdash;stop soon after.</p>

<p>Send as much of your stuff as possible by mail, especially
if you have the story in the late afternoon and are near
enough to St. Louis to reach <em>The Star</em> by 9 o'clock the next
morning. If necessary, send the letter special delivery.</p>

<p>Don't stop working on a good story when you have all the
facts; if there are photographs to be obtained, get the photographs,
especially if the principals in the story are persons of
standing, and more especially if they are women.</p>

<p>Correspondents will appreciably increase their worth to
<em>The Star</em> and enhance their earning capacity by observing
these rules.</p>

<br />
<small>NEWS VALUES</small></h2>


<p>Before any one can hope to write for a newspaper
he must know something about news values&mdash;something
about the essence of interest that makes one
story worth a column and cuts down another, of
equal importance from other points of view, to a
stickful. He must recognize the relative value of
facts so that he can distinguish the significant part
of his story and feature it accordingly. The question
is a delicate one and yet a very reasonable and
logical one. The ideal of a newspaper, according
to present-day ethics, is to print news. The daily
press is no longer a golden treasury of contemporary
literature, not even, perhaps, an exponent of political
principles. Its primary purpose is to report contemporary
history&mdash;to keep us informed concerning
the events that are taking place each day in the
world about us.</p>

<p>To this idea is added another. A newspaper must
be interesting. In these days of many newspapers
few readers are satisfied with merely being informed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they want to be informed in a way that
interests them. To this demand every one connected
with a newspaper office tries to cater. It is the defense
of the sensational yellow journals and it is
the reason for everything in the daily press. There
is so much to read that people will not read things
that do not interest them, and the paper that succeeds
is the paper that interests the greatest number
of readers. Circulation cannot be built up by printing
uninteresting stuff that the majority of readers
are not interested in, and circulation is necessary to
success.</p>

<p>This desire to interest readers is behind the whole
question of news values. News is primarily the account
of the latest events, but, more than that, it is
the account of the latest events that interest readers
who are not connected with these events. Further
than that, it is the account of the latest events that
interest the greatest number of readers. Susie
Brown may have sprained her ankle. The fact is
absorbingly interesting to Susie; it is even rather
interesting to her family and friends, even to her
enemies. If she is well known in the little town in
which she lives her accident may be interesting
enough to the townspeople for the local weekly to
print a complete account of it. However, the event
is interesting only to people who know Susie, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
after all they do not comprise a very large number.
Hence her accident has no news value outside the
local weekly. On the other hand, had Susie sprained
her ankle in some very peculiar manner, the accident
might be of interest to people who do not know
Susie. Suppose that she had tripped on her gown
as she was ascending the steps of the altar to be
married. Such an accident would be very unusual,
almost unheard of. People in general are interested
in unusual things, and many, many readers would be
interested in reading about Susie's unusual accident
although they did not know Susie or even the town
in which she lives. Such a story would be the report
of a late event that would interest many people;
hence it would have a certain amount of news value.
Of course, the reader loses sight of Susie in reading
of her accident&mdash;it might as well have been Mary
Jones&mdash;but that is because Susie has no news value
in herself. That is another matter.</p>

<p><b>1. Classes of Readers.</b>&mdash;Realizing that his story
must be of interest to the greatest number of people,
the reporter must remember the sort of people for
whom he is writing. That complicates the whole
matter. If he were writing for a single class of
readers he could easily give them the news that
would interest them. But he is not; he is writing
for many classes of people, for all classes of people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
And he must interest them all. He is writing for
the business man in his office, for the wife in the
home, for the ignorant, for the highly educated, for
the rich and the poor, for the old and the young, for
doctors, lawyers, bankers, laborers, ministers, and
women. All of them buy his paper to hear the latest
news told in a way that interests them, and he has
to cater to each and to all of them. If he were
simply writing for business men he would give them
many columns of financial news, but that would not
interest tired laborers. An extended account of the
doings of a Presbyterian convention would not attract
the great class of men with sporting inclinations,
and a story of a very pretty exhibition of
scientific boxing would not appeal to the wife at
home. They all buy the paper, and they all want to
be interested, and the paper must, therefore, print
stories that interest at least the majority of them.
That is the question of news values. The news
must be the account of the latest events that interest
the greatest number of readers of all classes.</p>

<p>This search for the universally-interesting news
is the reason behind the sensational papers. Although
the interests of any individual differ in almost
every aspect from the interests of his neighbor,
there is one sort of news that interests them both,
that interests every human being. That is the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that appeals to the emotions, to the heart. It is the
news that deals with human life&mdash;human nature&mdash;human
interest news the papers call it. In it every
human being is interested. However trivial may be
the event, if it can be described in a way that will
make the reader feel the point of view of the human
beings who suffered or struggled or died or who
were made happy in the event, every other human
being will read it with interest. Human sympathy
makes one want to feel joy and pain from the standpoint
of others. Naturally that sort of news is always
read; naturally the paper that devotes itself
to such news is always read and is always successful
as far as circulation and profits go. The papers that
have that ideal of news behind them and forsake
every other ideal for it are called sensational papers.
Whether they are good or not is another question.</p>

<p>With this idea of what news values means and
the idea that news is worth while only when it interests
the largest number of people of all classes,
we may try to look for the things that make news
interesting to the greatest number of people of all
classes. The reporter must know not only what
news is, but what makes it news. He must be able
to see the things in a story that will interest the
greatest number of people of all classes. These are
many and intricate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<b>2. Timeliness.</b>&mdash;In the first place, news must be
new. A story must have timeliness. Our readers
want to know what happened to-day, for yesterday
and last week are past and gone. They want to be
up to the minute in their information on current
events. Therefore a story that is worth printing to-day
will not be worth printing to-morrow or, at
most, on the day after to-morrow. Events must be
chronicled just as soon as they happen. Furthermore,
the story itself must show that it is new. It
must tell the reader at once that the event which it
is chronicling happened to-day or last night&mdash;at
least since the last edition of the paper. That is
why the reporter must never fail to put the time in
the introduction of his story. Editors grow gray-headed
trying to keep up with the swift passing of
events, and they are always very careful to tell their
readers that the events which they are chronicling
are the latest events. That is the reason why every
editor hates the word "yesterday" and tries to get
"to-day" or "this morning" into the lead of every
story. Hence, to the newspaper, everything that
happened since midnight last night is labeled "this
morning," and everything that happened since six
o'clock yesterday afternoon is labeled "last night."
Anything before that hour must be labeled "yesterday,"
but it goes in as "late yesterday afternoon,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
if it possibly can. Hence the first principle of news
values is timeliness&mdash;news is news only because it
just happened and can be spoken of as one of the
events of "to-day" or of "late yesterday."</p>

<p><b>3. Distance.</b>&mdash;Distance is another factor in news
values. In spite of fast trains and electric telegraphs
human beings are clannish and local in their interests.
They are interested mainly in things and persons
that they know, and news from outside their
ken must be of unusual significance to attract them.
They like to read about things that they have seen
and persons that they know, because they are slow
to exert their imaginations enough to appreciate
things that they do not know personally. Hence
every newspaper is primarily local, even though it is
a metropolitan daily, and news from a distance plays
a very subordinate part. It has been said that New
York papers cannot see beyond the Alleghanies; it is
equally true that most papers cannot see more
than a hundred miles from the printing office,
except in the case of national news. Any
newspaper's range of news sources goes out
from the editorial room in concentric circles.
Purely personal news must come from within
the range of the paper's general circulation,
because people do not care to read purely personal
news about persons whom they do not know. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
news is limited ordinarily to the region with which
the paper's readers are personally acquainted&mdash;the
state, perhaps&mdash;because subscribers unconsciously
wish to hear about places with which they are personally
acquainted. Any news that comes from
outside this larger circle must be nation-wide or very
unusual in its interest. A story that may be worth
a column in El Paso, Texas, would not be worth
printing in New York because El Paso is hardly
more than a name to most New York newspaper
readers. In the same way, the biggest stories in
New York are not worth anything in Texas, because
Texas readers are not personally interested in New
York&mdash;they cannot say, "Yes, I know that building;
I walked down that street the other day; oh, you
can't tell me anything about the subway." News is
primarily local, and the first thing a correspondent
must learn is how to distinguish the stories that are
purely local in their interest from those that would
be worth printing a hundred miles away in a paper
read by people who do not know the places or persons
involved in the story. Colonel Smith may be
a very big frog in the little puddle of Smith's Corners,
and his doings may be big news to the weeklies
all over his county, but he has to do something
very unusual before his name is worth a line in a
paper two counties away. He is nothing but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
name to people who do not know him or know of
him, and therefore they are not interested in him.
Every correspondent must watch for the stories
that have something more than a local interest, some
element of news in them that will carry them over
the obstacle of distance and make them interesting
to any reader.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to analyze news values to
the extent of telling every conceivable element of
interest that will overcome the obstacle of distance.
Yet there are certain elements that always make a
newspaper story interesting to any one.</p>

<p><b>4. Loss of life.</b>&mdash;One of these is the loss of human
life. For some strange reason every human
being is interested in the thought of death. Just
as soon as a story mentions death it is worth printing,
and if it has a number of deaths to tell about
it is worth printing anywhere. Any fire, any railroad
wreck, or any other disaster in which a number
of persons are killed or injured makes a story that
is worth sending anywhere. There seems to be a
joy for the reader in the mere number of fatalities.
A story that can begin with "Ten people were
killed," or "Seven men met their death," attracts a
reader's interest at once. As a very natural result,
and justly, too, newspapers have been broadly accused
of exaggeration for the sake of a large number.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
But at present many papers are inclined to
underestimate rather than overestimate, perhaps to
avoid this accusation. In a number of instances in
the past year, among them the Shirtwaist Factory
fire in New York, the first figures were smaller than
the official count printed later. That does not mean,
however, that newspapers do not want stories involving
loss of life. Any story which involves a
large number of fatalities will carry a long distance,
if for no other reason.</p>

<p><b>5. Big Names.</b>&mdash;Another element of news values is
the interest in prominent people. The mere mention
of a man or a woman who is known widely attracts
attention. Although Colonel Smith of Smith's Corners
has to do something very unusual to get his
name in any paper outside his county, the slightest
thing that President Taft does is printed in every
paper in the country. It is simply because of our
interest in the man himself. Some names give a
story news value because the names are widely
known politically or financially, some names because
they are simply notorious. But any name that is
recognized at once, for any reason, gives a story
news value.</p>

<p><b>6. Property Loss.</b>&mdash;Akin to man's love for any account
that involves large loss of human life, is his
love of any story that tells about a huge loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
property. The mere figures seem to have a charm;
any story that can begin with awesome figures, like
"Two million dollars," "One hundred automobiles,"
"Ten city blocks," has news value. Hence any story
that involves a large loss that can be expressed in
figures has the power to carry a great distance.</p>

<p><b>7. Unusualness.</b>&mdash;It is safe to say that newspaper
readers are interested in anything unusual. It does
not matter whether it is a thing, a person, an action,
a misfortune; so long as it is strange and out of the
range of ordinary lives, it is interesting. Many, if
not most, newspaper stories have nothing but the
element of strangeness in them to give them news
value, but if they are sufficiently strange and unusual
they may be copied all over the country. An
unusual origin or an unusual rescue will give an unimportant
fire great news value. And so with every
other kind of story.</p>

<p><b>8. Human Interest.</b>&mdash;Along with the element of the
strange and unusual, goes the human interest element.
Any story that will make us laugh or make
us cry has news value. Hundreds of magazines are
issued monthly with nothing in them but fictitious
stories that are intended to arouse our emotions, and
newspapers are beginning to realize that they can
interest their readers in the same way. No life is so
prosaic that it is not full of incidents that make one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
laugh or cry, and when these stories can be told in
a way that will make any reader feel the same emotions,
they have news value that will carry them a
long distance. Obviously their success depends very
largely upon the way they are told.</p>

<p><b>9. Personal Appeal.</b>&mdash;Another element that may
give a story news value is that of personal appeal or
application to the reader's own daily life. Men are
primarily egoistic and selfish and nothing interests
them more than things that affect them personally.
They can read complacently and without interest of
the misfortunes and joys of others, but just as soon
as anything affects their own daily lives, even a
little, they want to hear about it. Perhaps the price
of butter has gone up a few cents or the gas company
has reduced its rates from eighty cents to
seventy-seven. Every reader is interested at once,
for the news affects his own daily life. Sometimes
this personal appeal is due merely to the reader's
familiarity with the persons or places mentioned in
the story; sometimes it is due to the story's application
to his business life, his social or religious activities,
or to any phase of his daily existence. That
is the reason why political news interests every one,
for we all feel that the management of the government
has an influence on our own lives. The story
of any political maneuver&mdash;especially if it is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that may be looked upon as bad or good&mdash;carries
farther than any other story. Show that your story
tells of something that has even the slightest effect
on the lives of a large number of people and it needs
no other element to give it news value.</p>

<p><b>10. Local Reasons.</b>&mdash;These factors and many others
give news stories a news value that will carry them
a long distance and make them interesting in communities
far from their source. Many local reasons
may enhance the value of a story for local papers.
A paper's policy or some campaign that it is waging
may give an otherwise unimportant event a tremendous
significance. If an unimportant person is
slightly injured while leaving a trolley car the story
is hardly worth a line of type. But if such an item
should come to a newspaper while it is carrying on
a campaign against the local street railway company,
the story would probably be written and printed in
great detail. Any slight occurrence that may be in
line with a paper's political beliefs would receive an
amount of space far out of proportion with its ordinary
news worth. News value is a very changeable
and indefinite thing, and there are countless
reasons why any given story should be of interest to
a large number of readers. And the possibility of
interesting a large number of readers is the basis of
news value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<b>11. The Feature.</b>&mdash;In connection with the study of
news values the question of feature is important. In
editorial offices one is constantly hearing the word
"feature," and reporters are constantly admonished
to "play up the feature" of their stories. Feature is
the word that editors use to signify the essence of
news value. Every story that is printed is printed
because of some fact in it that makes it interesting&mdash;gives
it news value. The element in the story that
makes it interesting and worth printing is the feature.
The feature may be some prominent name, a
large list of fatalities, a significant amount of property
destroyed, or merely the unusualness of the incident.
This feature is the element that makes the
story news; therefore it is used to attract attention
to the story. Every newspaper story displays like a
placard in its headlines the reason why it was
printed&mdash;the element in it that makes it interesting.
"Playing up the feature" is simply the act of bringing
this feature to the front so that it will attract attention
to the story. Just how this is done we shall
see later. But when, as a reporter, you are looking
for a feature to play up in your lead, remember that
the feature to be played up is the thing in the story
that gives the story news value. And few stories
have more than one claim to news value, more than
one feature.</p>

<a name="iii" id="iii"></a>III<br />
<br />
<small>NEWSPAPER TERMS</small></h2>


<p>The newspaper vernacular that is used in the editorial
and press rooms of any daily paper is a curious
mixture of literary abbreviations and technical printing
terms. It is the result of the strange mingling
of the literary trade of writing with the mechanical
trade of setting type. For that reason a green reporter
has difficulty in understanding the instructions
that he receives until he has been in the office
long enough to learn the office slang. It would be
impossible to list all of the expressions that might
be heard in one day, but a knowledge of the commonest
words will enable a reporter to get the drift
of his editor's instructions.</p>

<p>When a young man secures a position as reporter
for a newspaper he begins as a <em>cub reporter</em> and is
usually said to be on the <em>staff</em> of his paper. His
sphere of activity is confined to the <em>editorial</em> room,
where the news is written; his relations with the
<em>business office</em>, where advertising, circulation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
other business matters are handled, consists of the
weekly duty of drawing his pay. His chief enemies
are in the <em>printing office</em> where his literary efforts are
<em>set up</em> in type and printed. His superiors are called
<em>editors</em> and exist in varying numbers, depending
upon the size of his paper. The man who directs the
reporters is usually called the <em>city editor</em>, or perhaps
the <em>day</em> or <em>night city editor</em>; above him there are
managing editors and other persons in authority
with whom the cub is not concerned; and the favored
mortals who enjoy a room by themselves and write
nothing but editorials are called editors or <em>editorial
writers</em>. There may also be a <em>telegraph</em> editor, a
<em>sporting</em> editor, a <em>Sunday</em> editor, and many other
editors; or if the paper is small and poor all of these
editors may be condensed into one very busy man.
On a city daily of average size there are <em>desk men</em>,
or <em>copyreaders</em>, who work under editorial direction
but feel superior to the reporter because they correct
his literary efforts.</p>

<p>The reporter's work consists of gathering and
writing news. In the office this is called <em>covering</em>
and writing <em>stories</em>. He is ordinarily put on a <em>beat</em>,
or <em>run</em>; this is simply a daily route or round of news
sources which he follows as regularly as a policeman
walks his beat. The reporter's work on a special
story outside his beat is called an <em>assignment</em>. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
hint that he may receive concerning a bit of news
is called a <em>tip</em>. Any bit of news that he secures to
the exclusion of his paper's rivals is called a <em>beat</em>,
or a <em>scoop</em>.</p>

<p>Everything that is written for the paper, whether
it be a two-line personal item or a two-column report,
is called a <em>story</em>, or a <em>yarn</em>, and from the time
the story is written until it appears in the printed
paper it is called <em>copy</em>. If the story is well written
and needs few corrections it is called <em>clean copy</em>.
After the story is written it is turned over to the
copyreader to be <em>edited</em>. The copyreader corrects it
and writes the headlines or <em>heads</em>; then he sends it to
the composing room to be set in type by the <em>compositor</em>.
The story itself is usually set up on a linotype
machine and the heads are set up by hand. For
the sake of keeping the two parts of the copy together
the reporter or the copyreader ordinarily
gives the story a name, such as "Fire No. 2"; the bit
of lead on which the name is printed is called a <em>slug</em>
and the story is said to be <em>slugged</em>. If at any time in
its journey from the reporter's pencil to the printed
page, the editor decides not to print the story, he
<em>kills</em> it; otherwise he <em>runs</em> it, or allows it to go into
the paper. When the story is in type, an impression,
or <em>proof</em>, is taken of it, and this proof, still called
copy, comes back to the copyreader or the proofreader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for the correction of typographical errors.
The gathering together of all of the day's stories
into the form of the final printed page is called <em>making
up</em> the paper; this is usually done by some one
of the editors. In like manner, the finished aspect
of the paper is called the <em>make-up</em>.</p>

<p>Some stories are said to be <em>big stories</em> because of
unusual news value. When any news comes unexpectedly
it is said to <em>break</em>; and when any story
comes in beforehand and must be held over, it is
said to be <em>released</em> on the day on which it may be
printed. The first paragraph of any story is called
the <em>lead</em> (pronounced "leed"); the word <em>lead</em> is also
used to designate several introductory paragraphs
that are tacked on at the beginning of a long story,
which may be of the nature of a <em>running story</em> (as
the running story of a football game), or may be
made up of several parts, written by one or more
reporters. In general, that part of a story which
presents the gist or summary of the entire story at
the beginning is called the <em>lead</em>. The most interesting
thing in the story, the part that gives it news
value, is called the <em>feature</em>, and <em>playing up the feature</em>
consists in telling the most interesting thing in
the first line of the lead or in the headline. An entire
story is said to be <em>played up</em> if it is given a
prominent place in the paper. A <em>feature story</em> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
either a story that is thus played up or a story that
is written for some other reason than news value,
such as human interest. When a story is rewritten
to give a new interest to old facts it is called a <em>rewrite
story</em>; when it is rewritten to include new
facts or developments, it is called a <em>follow-up</em>, <em>second-day</em>,
or <em>follow story</em>.</p>

<p>Because of the close relation between the editorial
room and the printing office many printing terms are
commonly heard about the editorial room. All copy
is measured by the <em>column</em> and by the <em>stickful</em>. A
column is usually a little less than 1,500 words and a
stickful is the amount of type that can be set in a
compositor's <em>stick</em>, the metal frame used in setting
type by hand&mdash;about two inches or 100 words. A
bit of copy that is set up with a border or a row of
stars about it is said to be <em>boxed</em>. Whenever copy
is set with extra space between the lines it is said
to be <em>leaded</em> (pronounced "leded")&mdash;the name is
taken from the piece of lead that is placed between
the lines of type. The reporter must gradually learn
the names of the various kinds of type and the various
proofreader's signs that are used to indicate the
way in which the type is to be set, for the whole
work of writing the news is governed and limited by
the mechanical possibilities of the printing office.
The commonest signs used by the proofreader or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
copyreader, together with instructions for preparing
copy, are given in the Style Book at the end of this
volume. (A complete list of proofreader's signs
can be found in the back of any large dictionary.)
<em>Style</em> is a word which editors use to cover a multitude
of rules, arbitrary or otherwise, concerning
capitalization, punctuation, abbreviation, etc. A paper
that uses many capital letters is said to follow an
<em>up</em> style, and a paper that uses small letters instead
of capitals whenever there is a choice is said to follow
a <em>down</em> style. Every newspaper has its own
style and usually prints its rules in a Style Book;
the Style Book given in this volume has been compiled
from many representative newspaper style
books. It sets forth an average style and the beginner
is advised to follow it closely in his practice
writing&mdash;for, as editors say, "uniformity is better
than a strict following of style."</p>

<br />
<small>THE NEWS STORY FORM</small></h2>


<p>When we come to the writing of the news we find
that there are many sorts of stories that must be
written. In the newspaper office they are called
simply stories without distinction. For the purpose
of study they may be classified to some extent, but
this classification must not be taken as hard and fast.
The commonest kind of story is the simple news
story. Practically all newspaper reports are news
stories, but as distinguished from other kinds of
reports the simple news story is the report of some
late event or occurrence. It is usually concerned
with unexpected news, and is the commonest kind of
story in any newspaper. It is to be distinguished
from reports of speeches, interview stories, court
reports, social news, dramatic news, sporting news,
human-interest stories, and all the rest. The distinction
is largely one of form and does not exist
to any great extent in a newspaper office where all
stories are simply "stories."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
The simple news story is probably the most variable
part of a newspaper. Given the same facts, each
individual reporter will write the story in his individual
way and each editor will change it to suit
his individual taste. No two newspapers have exactly
the same ideal form of news story and no
newspaper is able to live up to its individual ideal in
each story.</p>

<p>But there are general tendencies. Certain things
are true of all news stories; whether the story be
the baldest recital of facts or the most sensational
featuring of an imaginary thrill in a commonplace
happening, certain characteristics are always present.
And these characteristics can always be traced to
one cause&mdash;the effort to catch and hold the reader's
interest. When a busy American glances over his
newspaper while he sips his breakfast coffee or while
he clings to a strap on the way to his office, he reads
only the stories that catch his interest&mdash;and he reads
down the column in any one story only so long as his
interest is maintained. Hence the ideal news story
is one which will catch the reader's attention by its
beginning and hold his interest to the very end.
This is the principle of all newspaper writing.</p>

<p>The interest depends, in a large measure, on the
way the facts are presented. True, certain facts are
in themselves more interesting to a casual reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
than others, but just as truly other less interesting
facts may be made as interesting through the reporter's
skill. The most interesting of stories may lose
its interest if poorly presented, and facts of the most
commonplace nature may be made attractive enough
to hold the reader to the last word. The aim of
every reporter and of every editor is to make every
story so attractive and interesting that the most
casual reader cannot resist reading it.</p>

<p>In the old days news stories were written in the
logical order of events just like any other narrative,
but constant change has brought about a new form,
as different and individual as any other form of expression.
Unlike any other imaginable piece of
writing, the news story discloses its most interesting
facts first. It does not lead the reader up to a
startling bit of news by a tantalizing suspense in an
effort to build up a surprise for him; it tells its most
thrilling content first and trusts to his interest to
lead him on through the details that should logically
precede the real news. Therefore every editor admonishes
his reporters "to give the gist of the news
first and the details later."</p>

<p>There are other reasons for this peculiar reversal
of the logical order of narrative. Few readers have
time to read the whole of every story, and yet they
want to get the news&mdash;in the shortest possible time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Therefore the newspaper very kindly tells the important
part of each story at the beginning. Then
if the reader cares to hear the details he can read the
rest of the story; but he gets the news, anyway.
Again, if the exigencies of making up the stories
into a paper of mechanically limited space require
that a story be cut down, the editor may slash off a
paragraph or two at the end without depriving the
story of its interest. Imagine the difficulty of cutting
down a story that is told in its logical order!
If the real news of the story were in the last paragraph
it would go in the slashing, and what would
be left? Whereas, if the gist of the story comes
first the editor may run any number of paragraphs
or even the first paragraph alone and still have a
complete story.</p>

<p>The arrangement of news stories in American
newspapers is thus a very natural one, resulting
from the exigencies of the business. Just how to fit
every story to this arrangement is a difficult task.
However, there are certain rules that the reporter
may apply to each story, and these are very simple.</p>

<p>In the first place, almost every story has a feature&mdash;there
is some one thing in it that is out of the ordinary,
something that gives it interest and news
value beyond the interest in the incident behind it.
No two stories have the same interesting features;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
if they had, only one of them would be worth printing
and that would be the first. This extraordinary
feature the reporter must see at once. If a building
burns he must see quickly what incident in the occurrence
will be of interest to readers who are reading
of many fires every day. If John Smith falls off
a street car the reporter must discover some interesting
fact in connection with Mr. Smith's misfortune
that will be new and attractive to readers who
do not know John and are bored with accounts of
other Smiths' accidents. The accident itself may
be interesting, but the part of the accident that is out
of the ordinary&mdash;the thing that gives the accident
news value&mdash;is the feature of the story, and the
reporter must tell it first.</p>

<p>Thoroughly determined to tell the most interesting
part, the gist, of his story in the first paragraph, the
reporter must remember that there are certain other
things about the incident that the reader wants to
know just as quickly. There are certain questions
which arise in the reader's mind when the occurrence
is suggested, and these questions must be answered
as quickly as they are asked. The questions usually
take the form of <em>when?</em> <em>where?</em> <em>what?</em> <em>who?</em> <em>how?</em>
<em>why?</em> If a man falls off the street car we are eager
to know at once who he was, although we probably
do not know him, anyway; where it happened; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it happened; how he fell; and why he fell. If there
is a fire we immediately ask what burned; where it
was; when it burned; how it burned; and what
caused it to burn. And the reporter must answer
these questions with the same breath that tells us
that a man fell off the car or that there was any fire
at all.</p>

<p>The effort to answer these questions at once has
led to the peculiar form of introduction characteristic
of every newspaper story. Newspaper people
call it the lead. It is really nothing but the statement
of the briefest possible answers to all these
questions in one sentence or one short paragraph.
It tells the whole story in its baldest aspects and aims
to satisfy the reader who wants only the gist of the
story and does not care for the details. When all
his questions have been answered in one breath he
is ready to read the details one at a time, but he
won't be satisfied if he must read all about how the
fire was discovered before he is told what building
burned, when it burned, etc. For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire of unknown origin caused the
practical destruction of the famous old
"Crow's Nest," at Tenth and Cedar
streets, perhaps the best known and
oldest landmark in the Second ward,
yesterday afternoon.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free
Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
This is the lead of an ordinary news story&mdash;a
newspaper report of a fire. The lead begins with
"Fire" because the story has no unusual feature&mdash;no
element in it that is more interesting than the
fact that there was a fire. The reporter considers
"Fire" the most important part of his story and begins
with it. As soon as we read the word "Fire"
we ask, "When?"&mdash;"Where?"&mdash;"What?"&mdash;"Why?"&mdash;"How?"
The reporter answers us in
the same sentence with his announcement, "yesterday
afternoon"&mdash;"at Tenth and Cedar Streets"&mdash;"the
famous old 'Crow's Nest,' perhaps the best
known and oldest landmark in the Second ward"&mdash;"unknown
origin." <em>How</em> is not worth answering,
in this case, beyond the statement that the destruction
was practically complete. Thus the reporter
has told us his bit of news and answered our most
obvious questions about it at the very beginning of
his story&mdash;in one sentence. According to newspaper
rules this is a good lead. The order of the answers
will be considered later. For the present we
are concerned only with the facts that the lead must
contain.</p>

<br />
<small>THE SIMPLE FIRE STORY</small></h2>


<p>The simplest news story is the story which has no
feature&mdash;which has no fact in it more important
than the incident which it reports&mdash;e.g., the fire at
the end of the last chapter. If we recall the various
elements of news value we note that any incident
may be given greater news value by the presence of
some unusual or interesting feature&mdash;a great loss of
life, an unusual time, a strikingly large loss of property,
or simply a well-known name. Such a story is
called a story with a feature, because its interest depends
not so much on the incident itself as upon the
unusual feature within the incident. On the other
hand, many news stories do not have features. Many
stories are worth printing simply because of the incident
which they report, without any unusual feature
within them. For example, a building may burn
with no loss of life, no great loss of property, and
no striking occurrence in connection with the burning.
Such a fire is worth reporting, but there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fact in the story more interesting than the fact that
there was a fire; the story has no feature.</p>

<p>The leads of these two kinds of stories are different.
When a story has a feature it is customary
to play up that feature in the first line of the lead.
If the story has no feature, is simply the record of a
commonplace event, the lead merely announces the
incident and answers the reader's questions about it.</p>

<p>The commonest of featureless stories is the simple
fire story in which nothing out of the ordinary happens,
no one is killed, no striking rescues take place,
and no tremendous amount of property is destroyed.
This may be taken as typical of all featureless stories.
The reporter, in writing a report of such a fire,
merely answers in the lead the questions <em>when</em>,
<em>where</em>, <em>what</em>, <em>why</em>, and perhaps <em>how</em>, that the reader
asks concerning the fire. The most striking part
of the story is that there was a fire; hence the story
begins with "Fire." For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire today wrecked the top of the
six-story warehouse at 393 to 395
Washington street, used by the United
States army as a medical supply store-room
for the Department of the East.
Capt. Edwin Wolf, who is in charge
of the warehouse, says the loss on tents,
blankets, cots, and other bedding stored
on the floors of the building was large.&mdash;<em>New
York Mail.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
As one reads down through the rest of the story
he finds nothing more striking than the fact that
there was a fire. Therefore there is no particular
feature. No one was killed; no one was injured;
the loss was not extraordinary for a New York fire&mdash;nothing
in the story is of greater interest than the
mere fact that there was a fire. Hence the story begins
with the word "Fire." Notice that it does not
begin "A fire" or "The fire"&mdash;for the simple reason
that the word <em>fire</em> does not need an article before it.
The editor will also tell you that it is not considered
good to begin a story with an article, for the beginning
is the most important part of a story and it is
foolish to waste that advantageous place on unimportant
words.</p>

<p>The first word tells the reader that there has been
a fire. He immediately asks where?&mdash;what burned?&mdash;when?&mdash;how
much was lost? And the reporter
proceeds to answer his questions in their order of
importance. The reporter who wrote this story apparently
thought that the time was of greatest importance
and slipped it in at once&mdash;"today." He
might just as well have left the time until the end
of the sentence because it is not of very great interest.
He considers the question "<em>Where</em>" of next
importance, and answers with "the top of the six-story
warehouse at 393 to 395 Washington Street."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
The question "what?" he answers with a clause,
"used by the United States army as a medical supply
store-room for the Department of the East." He
does not try to answer the question "<em>why?</em>" because,
as the rest of the story tells us, no one knew exactly
what caused the fire. And as for the "<em>How?</em>" there
is nothing extraordinary in the way that it burned
beyond the fact that it burned. Thus, in one sentence,
he has answered all four questions about the
fire, except a little query concerning the amount of
the loss. That he considers worth a separate sentence
of details.</p>

<p>This is not a perfect lead. Many editors would
consider it faulty, but it illustrates one way of writing
the lead of a featureless fire story. Obviously
there are faults; for instance, the time is
given an undue amount of emphasis and the cause
is omitted.</p>

<p>Suppose that we construct another lead from the
same story&mdash;a lead which would be more in accordance
with the logic of newspaper writing.
We shall begin with the word "fire," but after it
we shall slip in a little mention of the cause
since to the reader not directly acquainted with the
property that point is always of the greatest importance.
Then we shall tell where the fire was
and after that what was burned. And last of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
we shall give the time since that is of least importance
to the average reader. This would be
the result:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire of unknown origin wrecked the
top of the six-story warehouse at 393-395
Washington street, used by the
United States army as a medical supply
store-room for the Department of
the East, destroying a large number of
tents, blankets, cots, and other bedding,
today.</p>
</div>

<p>We might as well have put the <em>what</em> before the
<em>where</em> or altered the lead in any other way. But we
would always begin with the word "fire" and answer
all the questions that the reader might ask&mdash;in one
short simple sentence. This constitutes our lead.
We have told the casual reader what he wants to
know about the fire. We give him more details
about the fire if he wants to read them, but after we
have stated the case clearly in the lead we no longer
reckon his time so carefully and allow ourselves
some latitude in the telling. After the lead we begin
the story from the beginning and tell it in its logical
order from start to finish, always bearing in mind
that the editor may chop off a paragraph or two at
the end.</p>

<p>Hence the second paragraph of the story as it
appeared in <em>The Mail</em> begins:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
John Smith, a man employed in the
stock-room on the sixth floor, saw
smoke rolling out of one corner and
notified other employees in the building,
while Patrolman Hogan turned in
an alarm.</p>
</div>

<p>We are back at the beginning now and telling
things as they came. The next paragraph of the
story tells us how they fought the fire, and the third
tells us how they finally brought it under control.
The last paragraph of the story reads:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">There are three such warehouses in
the country, one at St. Louis, another
at San Francisco, but the one in this
city is by far the largest. In it are
kept supplies for the Departments of the
East, Gulf, Cuba, Porto Rico, and the
Philippines.</p>
</div>

<p>The editor of <em>The Mail</em> had plenty of space that
day and saw fit to run this last paragraph, but we
should not have lost much had he chopped it off.
Perhaps the reporter's copy contained still another
paragraph telling about Captain Wolf, but that did
not pass the editorial pencil. Even more of the
story might have been slashed without depriving
us of much of the interesting news.</p>

<p>Judging from the above story a newspaper account
is divided into two separate and independent
parts: the lead and the detailed account. The lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
is written for the casual reader and contains all the
necessary facts about the fire; it may stand alone
and constitute a story in itself. The detailed account
is written for the reader who wants to hear more
about the incident, and is written in the logical order
of events&mdash;with an eye to the danger of the editor's
pencil threatening the last paragraphs. In other
words, the reporter tells his story briefly in one paragraph
and then goes back and tells it all over again
in a more detailed way. If the story is of sufficient
importance the second telling may not be sufficient
and he may go back a third time to the beginning
and tell it again with still greater detail&mdash;but that
is another matter. For the present we shall consider
only the lead and the first detailed account.</p>

<p>There are certain other points to be noticed in
the report of a featureless fire. Under no condition
should it begin with the time. Why? Because,
unless the time is of extreme interest, no one cares
particularly when the fire occurred. And if the time
is of great interest&mdash;as, for instance, if a church
should burn while the congregation is in it&mdash;then the
time becomes a feature to be played up and the story
is no longer a featureless story. We are now considering
stories in which nothing is of greater interest
than the mere fact that there was a fire.</p>

<p>The same is true of the location. Who cares what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
street the fire was on until he knows more about the
fire? If the location were of such significant importance
as to be played up, the story would no
longer be a featureless story.</p>

<p>The paragraphing is also important. Since the
lead is in itself a separate part of the story it should
always be paragraphed separately. Do not let the
beginning of the detailed account lap over into the
lead, and do not introduce into the first paragraph
any facts which are not absolutely a part of the lead&mdash;that
is, facts that are absolutely essential to a general
knowledge of the fire. When once you begin
to tell the story in detail tell it logically and paragraph
it logically. Do not tell us that John Smith
discovered the fire and that the loss is $500 in the
same paragraph. Take up each point separately and
treat it fully before you leave it&mdash;then begin a new
paragraph for the next item.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>To take a hypothetical case, suppose that misfortune
visits the home of John H. Jones, who lives at
79 Liberty Street. A defective flue sets his house
on fire and it burns to the ground. By inquiry we
find that the house is worth about $4,000 and is fully
insured.</p>

<p>There is nothing particularly striking about the
story. We are sorry for Mr. Jones, but many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
houses worth $4,000 are set on fire by poor chimneys
and many more houses burn down. No one
was hurt, no one was killed; the most striking part
of it all is that there was a fire. We would begin
with the word "Fire." Perhaps our readers would
be most interested in the cause of the fire and we
shall tell them that first. Then we shall tell them
what burned, when it burned, and where it stood.
There is nothing else that a casual reader would
want to know and the lead would read:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire starting in a defective chimney
destroyed the residence of John H.
Jones, 79 Liberty street, at midnight last
night, causing a loss of $4,000, covered
by insurance.</p>
</div>

<p>Our casual reader is satisfied. For the reader
who wishes to know more about the fire we add a
paragraph or two of detail. First, we may tell him
who discovered the fire; then how the Jones family
managed to escape; and after that how the fire was
extinguished, and we might slip in a paragraph explaining
just what trouble in the chimney made a
fire possible. The editor may chop off any number
of paragraphs or cut the story down to the lead, and
yet our readers will get the facts and know just exactly
what was the reason for the fire bell and the
red sky at midnight last night.</p>

<br />
<small>THE FEATURE FIRE STORY</small></h2>


<p>A fire story without a feature begins with "Fire"
because there is nothing in the story more interesting
than the fact that there has been a fire. Such was
the case in the burning of John Jones's house in the
last chapter. But just as soon as any part of the
story becomes more interesting than the fact that
there was a fire, the story is no longer featureless&mdash;it
is a fire story with a feature, or, for the purposes
of our study, <em>a feature fire story</em>. This feature may
be related to the story in one of two ways. In the
first place, the answer to some one of the reader's
questions may be the feature&mdash;e.g., the answer to
<em>when</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>what</em>, <em>how</em>, <em>why</em>, <em>who</em>. On the other
hand, the feature may be in some unexpected attendant
circumstance that the reader would not think
of; for instance, loss of life, an interesting rescue, or
something of that sort. Such a distinction is entirely
arbitrary and would not be considered in a
newspaper office, but it will make the matter simpler
for the purposes of study.</p>


<p class="c2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
A. FEATURES IN ANSWERS TO READER'S CUSTOMARY
QUESTIONS</p>

<p class="c">(<em>When</em>, <em>Where</em>, <em>What</em>, <em>How</em>, <em>Why</em>, <em>Who</em>).</p>

<p>Suppose that John Jones's house did not burn in
the usual way&mdash;suppose that there is some striking
incident in the story that makes it different from
other fire stories. The story has a feature. Perhaps
the answer to some one of the reader's customary
questions is more interesting than the answers to
the others&mdash;so much more interesting that it supersedes
even the fact that there was a fire. Then it
would be foolish to begin with the mere word "fire"
when we have something more interesting to tell.
The fire takes a second place and we begin with the
interesting fact that supersedes it. For the present
we shall consider that this interesting fact is the
answer to one of the questions that the reader always
asks; for instance, why the house burned or
when it burned.</p>

<p><b>1. Why.</b>&mdash;Perhaps Mr. Jones's house was set on
fire in a very unusual way. There was a little party
in session at the Jones's and some one decided to
take a flash-light picture. The flash-light set fire
to a lace curtain and before any one could stop it
the house was afire. Few fires begin in that way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and our readers would be very interested in hearing
about it. The story has a feature in the answer to
the reader's <em>Why?</em> And so we would begin our
lead in this way:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">A flashlight setting fire to a lace
curtain started a fire which destroyed
the residence of John H. Jones, 79 Liberty
street, at 11 o'clock last night and
caused a loss of $4,000.</p>
</div>

<p>In this way the feature is played up at the beginning
of the sentence, and yet the rest of the reader's
questions are answered in the same sentence and he
knows a great deal about the fire. Or, leaving Mr.
Jones to his fate, we may give another example of
an unusual cause taken from a newspaper. This
was a big fire, and yet the unusual cause was of
greater interest than the fire itself or the amount of
property destroyed:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">A tiny "joss stick," the lighted end of
which was no larger than a pinhead,
is thought to have been responsible for
a fire that destroyed the White City
Amusement Park at Broad Ripple last
night. The loss to the amusement company
is $161,000.&mdash;<em>Indianapolis News.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>2. Where.</b>&mdash;To return to Mr. Jones, there may
have been some other incident in the burning of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
house aside from the cause that was of exceptional
interest. Let us say that his house stood in a part
of the town where a fire was to be feared. Perhaps
it stood within twenty feet of the new First Congregational
Church. The burning of Jones's house
would then be insignificant in comparison to the
danger to the costly edifice beside it, and our readers
would be more interested in an item concerning their
church. The answer to <em>Where?</em> is more interesting
than the fire itself. Hence we would bury, so to
speak, Mr. Jones's misfortune behind the greater
danger, and the story would read:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire endangered the new First Congregational
Church on Liberty street,
erected at a cost of $100,000, when the
home of J. H. Jones, in the rear of the
church, was destroyed at midnight last
night.</p>
</div>

<p>Or:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The First Congregational Church, recently
built at a cost of $100,000, was
seriously threatened by a fire which destroyed
the residence of John H. Jones,
78 Liberty street, within twenty feet of
the church, at midnight last night.</p>
</div>

<p>Turning again to the daily papers, we can find
many fire stories in which the location of the burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
structure is important enough to take the first line
of the lead. Here is one:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The Plaza Hotel had a few uncomfortable
moments last night when flames
from a building adjoining at 22 West
Fifty-ninth street were shooting up as
high as the tenth story of the hotel and
the fire apparatus which responded to
the delayed alarm was looking for the
blaze several blocks away.&mdash;<em>New York
Sun.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>3. When.</b>&mdash;Sometimes the time of the fire is very
interesting. John H. Jones's house may have caught
fire from a very insignificant thing and its location
may have been unimportant, but the fire may have
come at an unusual time. Perhaps Mr. Jones's
daughter was being married at a quiet home wedding
in her father's house and in the midst of the
ceremony the roof of the house burst into flames.
The unusual time would be interesting; the answer
to <em>When?</em> would be the feature. We might write
the lead thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">During the wedding of Miss Mary
Jones at the home of her father, John
H. Jones, 78 Liberty street, last night,
the house suddenly burst into flames
and the bridal party was compelled to
flee into the street.</p>
</div>

<p>Or:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Fire interrupted the wedding of Miss
Mary Jones at her father's home, 78
Liberty street, last night, when the
house caught fire from a defective chimney
during the ceremony.</p>
</div>

<p>The daily papers furnish many illustrations of
fires at unusual times&mdash;here is one:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">When the snowstorm was at its height
early this morning, a three-story brick
building at Nos. 4410-18 Third Avenue,
Brooklyn, caught fire, and the flames
spread rapidly to an adjoining tenement,
sending a small crowd of shivering tenants
into the icy street.&mdash;<em>New York
Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>4. What.</b>&mdash;(<em>a</em>) <em>The Burned Building.</em>&mdash;Many fire
stories have their feature in the answer to the reader's
<em>What?</em> Not infrequently the building itself is
of great importance. Naturally "The residence of
John H. Jones" would not make a good beginning,
if John Jones is not well known, because people
would be more interested in reading about a mere
fire than in reading about the residence of John H.
Jones, whom they do not know. For it must be remembered
that it is the first line that catches the
reader's eye and the interest or lack of interest in
the first line determines whether or not the story is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to be read. Now, suppose that a building that is
very well known burns&mdash;the City Hall, the Albany
State House, the Herald Square Theater&mdash;the mere
mention of the building will attract the reader's attention.
Therefore the reporter begins with the answer
to <em>What?</em> the name of the building, as in the
following cases:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">GLENS FALLS, N. Y., Aug. 17.&mdash;The
Kaatskill House, for many years a
popular Lake George resort, was completely
destroyed by fire this forenoon.&mdash;<em>New
York Times.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The First M. E. Church of Chelsea,
familiarly known as the Cary avenue
church, was damaged last night to the
amount of $7,000 by fire.&mdash;<em>Boston Herald.</em></p>
</div>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>The Amount of Property Destroyed.</em>&mdash;The
answer to <em>What burned?</em> is not necessarily a building,
for the building itself may not be worth featuring.
The contents of the building may be more interesting,
especially if the amount of property destroyed
can be put in striking terms, such as $2,000,000
worth of property, or two thousand chickens,
or fifty-three automobiles, or 7,000 gallons of
whisky. These figures printed at the beginning of
the first paragraph catch the reader's eye, thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Five automobiles, valued at $5,800,
and property amounting to $6,200 were
destroyed last evening when fire broke
in the repair shop of the G. W. Browne
Motor company, 228-232 Wisconsin
street, near the North-Western station.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>5. How.</b>&mdash;Very rarely the manner in which a fire
burns is quite unique and deserves featuring. It is
inconceivable that John Jones's house could burn in
any very unusual way&mdash;"with many explosions,"
"with a glare of flames that aroused the whole city,"
"with vast clouds of oily smoke"&mdash;but some fires do
burn in some such a way and are interesting only for
the way they burned. The following story begins
with the answer to <em>How?</em> although the manner
might be described more explicitly:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Stubborn fires have been fought in the
past, but one of the hardest blazes to
conquer that the local department ever
contended with gutted the plant of N.
Drucker &amp; Co., manufacturers of trunks
and valises, at the northwest corner of
Ninth and Broadway, last night.&mdash;<em>Cincinnati
Commercial Tribune.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>6. Who.</b>&mdash;Just as it would be foolish to begin with
"the residence of John Jones," since the building is
not well known, it would not be advisable to begin
with John Jones's name, no matter what part he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
played. John Jones is not well known and so to
the newspaper he is just a man and is treated impersonally
regardless of what he does or what happens
to him. Our interest in him is entirely impersonal,
and all we want to know about him is what
he has done or what has happened to him. Therefore
few reporters would begin a story with John
Jones's name. However, let some man who is well
known do or suffer the slightest thing and his name
immediately lends interest to the story&mdash;and therefore
commands first place in the introduction. If
John D. Rockefeller should even witness a fire, or if
President Taft should be in the slightest way connected
with a fire, the mere fire story would shrink
into significance behind the name. And so, very
often it is advisable to begin a fire story with a name,
if the name is of sufficient prominence. It is not
necessary that the well-known man's property be destroyed
or even endangered for his name to have the
first place in the first sentence of the lead; if the
well-known man has anything whatever to do with
the fire his name should be featured because to the
average reader the interest in his name overshadows
any interest in the fire. In this example, the name
overshadows a striking loss of property and the story
begins with the answer to <em>Who?</em></p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.&mdash;While Clendenin
J. Ryan, son of Thomas F. Ryan,
the traction magnate, and a band of volunteer
fire fighters&mdash;many of them millionaires&mdash;fought
a blaze which started
in the garage of young Ryan's country
estate near Suffern, N. Y., early in the
morning, three valuable automobiles,
seven thoroughbred horses and several
outbuildings were totally destroyed.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that in each of the above feature
fire stories some incident in the fire, or connected
with the fire, overshadows the mere fact that there
was a fire and makes it advisable to begin the story
of the fire with the fact or incident of unusual interest.
Furthermore, in each of these stories the unusual
feature in the story is a direct answer to one
of the reader's questions&mdash;<em>when?</em> <em>where?</em> <em>how?</em>
<em>what?</em> <em>why?</em> <em>who?</em> In other words, the reporter in
answering these questions, as he must in the lead of
every story, finds the answer to one question so
much more interesting than the answer to any of the
other questions that he puts it first. In every fire
story, however, the feature is not so easily discovered.</p>

<p class="c2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
B. FEATURES IN UNEXPECTED ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES</p>

<p>There are other things in the day's fire stories,
besides the answers to the reader's questions, that
may overshadow the rest of the story and deserve to
be featured. Very often there are unexpected attendant
circumstances occurring simultaneously with
the fire or resulting from the fire to command our
interest. Perhaps a number of people are killed or
injured; then we want to know about them first, and
the reporter neglects to answer our questions for the
moment while he tells us the startling attendant circumstances
that we had not expected. Even so,
while giving first place to the feature, he does not
forget our questions but answers them in the same
sentence. Hence the introduction of a fire story
with significant attendant circumstances begins with
the startling fact resulting from the fire and then
goes on to answer the reader's questions&mdash;in the
same sentence.</p>

<p>This is not so difficult as it may sound. Suppose
that when John Jones's house burns there is a stiff
breeze blowing and the chances are that all the other
houses in the block will go with it. All of his neighbors
become frightened and work with feverish
haste to move their household goods out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
street. In the end the fire department succeeds in
confining the fire to Mr. Jones's house and his
neighbors promptly carry their chattels back indoors
thanking the god of good luck. Now the mere fact
that John Jones's house burned down is rather insignificant
beside the fact that a dozen families were
driven from their homes by the fire. Therefore the
reporter would begin thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Twelve families were driven from
their homes by a fire which destroyed
the residence of John H. Jones, 78 Liberty
street, at 11 o'clock last night. The
fire was at length kept from spreading
and the neighboring residences were
reoccupied.</p>
</div>

<p>Or to take an incident from the daily press in
which the neighbors were not so fortunate; although
they might have entirely lost their homes:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Twenty-two families in the six-story
tenement at 147 Orchard street were
routed out of the house twice early today
by fires which caused a great deal
of smoke, but little real damage.&mdash;<em>New
York Mail.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>1. Death.</b>&mdash;(a) <em>Number of Dead.</em>&mdash;The most
usual attendant circumstances that will come to our
notice is death in the fire. Let us say that Mr.
Jones's three children were alone in the house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
burned to death. Their death would be of more interest
to us than the burning of their father's house&mdash;and
our story would necessarily begin in this way:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Three children were burned to death
in a fire which destroyed the home of
their father, John H. Jones, 78 Liberty
street, last night.</p>
</div>

<p>So common is death in connection with fire that
almost every day's paper contains one or more stories
beginning "Ten persons were cremated&mdash;&mdash;" or
"Four firemen were killed&mdash;&mdash;" And in every case
the loss of human life is considered of greater importance
than any other incident in the story, and
the number of dead always takes precedence over
many another startling feature. Here are a few
examples:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">JOHNSTOWN, Pa., Jan. 18.&mdash;Seven
men were cremated in a fire that burned
to the ground three double houses near
Berlin, Somerset County, early this
morning.&mdash;<em>New York Sun.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Three children of Mr. and Mrs. Bernard
Lindberg, 3328 Nineteenth avenue
south, were cremated in a fire which
destroyed their home shortly after 12
o'clock yesterday. The children had
been left alone in the house, shut up in
their bedroom, etc.&mdash;<em>St. Paul Pioneer
Press.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
One fireman was killed, another fireman
and a woman were injured and
eight people escaped death by a narrow
margin Saturday night in a fire
which destroyed the, etc.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">NEW YORK, March 27.&mdash;One hundred
and forty-one persons are dead as
a result of the fire which on Saturday
afternoon swept the three upper floors
of the factory loft building at the northwest
corner of Washington place and
Greene street. More than three-quarters
of this number are women and girls,
who were employed in the Triangle
Shirt Waist factory, where the fire originated.&mdash;<em>Boston
Transcript.</em></p>
</div>

<p>(b) <em>List of Dead.</em>&mdash;When the number of dead or
injured reaches any very significant figure it is customary
to make a table of dead and injured. This
table is usually set into the story close after the lead,
but very often the list is put in a "box" and slipped
in above the story. In writing the story, however,
the reporter disregards the table and begins his lead
as if there were no table: e.g., "Twelve firemen were
killed and fourteen injured in a fire&mdash;&mdash;" The list
usually gives the name, address (or some other identification),
and the nature of the injury, thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="c"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<b>Injured Firemen:</b></p>

<p>Capt. Frank Makal, Engine Co. No.
4, cut by glass.</p>

<p>Acting Captain W. E. Brown, fire
boat No. 23, cut by glass.</p>

<p>Peter Ryan, No. 15, flying glass.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Or:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="c"><b>The Dead:</b></p>

<p>Mrs. Charles Smith, 14 W. Gorham
street.</p>

<p>John Johnson, 1193 Chatham street.</p>

<p class="c"><b>The Injured:</b></p>

<p>Thomas Green, 1111 Grand street;
face cut by flying glass.</p>

<p>James Brown, 176 Orchard avenue;
internal injuries; may die.</p>
</div>

<p>(c) <em>Manner of Death.</em>&mdash;A number of fatalities at
the beginning always attracts attention. Not infrequently
the manner or the cause, especially in the
case of a single death, is worth the first place in the
lead&mdash;not as "One man killed&mdash;&mdash;" but as "Crushed
beneath a falling wall, a man was killed." If a man
burns to death in a very unusual way, or for an unusual
reason, we are more interested in the way he
was burned, or the reason that he burned, than in
the mere fact that he was burned to death. The
first line then tells us how or why he was burned.
Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
To save his money, which he hoped
would some day raise him from the
rank of a laborer to that of a prosperous
merchant, Hing Lee, a Chinese
laundryman, ran back into his burning
laundry at 3031 Nicollet avenue today,
after he was once safe from the flames,
and was so badly burned that physicians
say he cannot live.&mdash;<em>Minneapolis
Journal.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>2. Injuries.</b>&mdash;Very often no one is killed in a fire
but some one is injured. For example, five firemen
are overcome by ammonia fumes or two men are
seriously injured by a falling wall. This then becomes
the feature. Injuries to human beings, if
serious or in any considerable number, take precedence
over other features, just as loss of human life
does. Here is an example from the press in which
all the injuries are gathered together at the beginning:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Six firemen and two laborers were
overcome by smoke, while three other
firemen received minor injuries by flying
glass in a fire which broke out yesterday
morning at 10:30 o'clock in the
Wellauer-Hoffman building, at, etc.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>3. Rescues.</b>&mdash;(a) <em>Number of People Rescued.</em>&mdash;When
people are rescued from great danger in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fire their escape makes a very good feature. If many
of them are rescued or escape very narrowly, the
mere number of people saved deserves the first place,
as:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">More than 150 men and women were
saved from death today in a fire at 213-217
Grand street by toboganning from
the roof of the burning structure on a
board chute to the roof of an adjoining
five-story building.&mdash;<em>New York Mail.</em></p>
</div>

<p>(b) <em>Manner of Rescue.</em>&mdash;But more often the
manner of their escape interests us most. If a man
slides down a rope for four stories to escape death
by fire we are more interested in how he saved himself
than in the fact that he didn't burn, and so we
tell how he escaped, in the first line. In the same
way, if unusual means are used to save one or more
persons, the means of rescue is usually worth featuring.
For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Overcoats used as life nets saved the
lives of a dozen women and children
in a fire of incendiary origin in the
three-story frame tenement house at 137
Havemeyer avenue, Brooklyn, to-day,
etc.&mdash;<em>New York Mail.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>4. Property Threatened.</b>&mdash;Death and injury are the
commonest unexpected circumstances in fire stories,
but they are not the only ones that may be worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
featuring. There is an inconceivable number of
things that may happen at a fire and overshadow
all interest in the fire itself. A good feature may
be found in the property that is threatened. Often
the fire in itself is insignificant, but because of a
high wind or other circumstances it threatens to
spread to neighboring buildings or to devastate a
large area. In such a case the amount of property
threatened or endangered deserves a place in the
very first line, especially if it exceeds the amount of
property actually destroyed and if it can be put in a
striking way; <em>i. e.</em>, the entire waterfront district, or
twenty-five dwelling houses, or $5,000,000 worth of
property. When contrasted with the small amount
of damage actually done, the amount that is threatened
becomes more important. Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire that for a time threatened $2,000,000
worth of property destroyed $15,000
worth of lumber owned by the
Milwaukee Lumber Company, 725 Clinton
street, yesterday....</p>

<p class="nt nb">The territory between Mitchell street
and the Kinnickinnic river and Reed
street, to the lake, containing manufactories,
dwellings and stores, was menaced.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
News.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>5. Fire Fighting.</b>&mdash;Not unusually a serious fire results
from the fact that it was not checked for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
reason or other during its earlier stages. Perhaps
the whole thing might have been avoided, or, on the
contrary, a big fire may be extinguished with unexpected
ease or unusual skill. In rare cases this matter
of very efficient or very inefficient fire fighting is
of sufficient importance to take the first place in the
lead. For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Almost total lack of water pressure
is blamed for the big loss in a fire
started by a firebug to-day in the five-story
factory building of Lamchick
Brothers, manufacturing company, 400-402
South Second street, Williamsburg.&mdash;<em>New
York Mail.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Rotten hose, which burst as fast as it
was put in use, imperiled the lives of
more than a score of firemen to-day at
a blaze which swept the three-story
frame flat house at Third avenue and
Sixty-seventh street, Brooklyn, from
cellar to roof, etc.&mdash;<em>New York Mail.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>6. Crowd.</b>&mdash;Not uncommonly in the city a tremendous
crowd gathers to watch a fire and blocks traffic
for hours. In the absence of other significant incidents&mdash;death,
great loss, etc.&mdash;the reporter may begin
his story with an account of the crowd present
or the blockade of traffic. Such a beginning should
always be used only as a last resort when a fire has
no other interesting phase, for crowds always gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
at fires and only a very serious blocking of traffic
is worth reporting. Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fully 15,000 persons were attracted
to the scene of the fire in the portion
of the plant of the Greenwald Packing
Company, Claremont Stock Yards,
which was discovered at 4:56 yesterday
afternoon.&mdash;<em>Baltimore American.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt">Twenty-five thousand people jammed
Broadway between Bleecker and Bond
streets yesterday noon and had the excitement
of watching 250 girls escape
from a twelve-story loft building which
was afire.&mdash;<em>New York Sun.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>7. Miscellaneous.</b>&mdash;There is an infinite number of
things that may happen at a fire and overshadow the
mere fire interest. These are the things that make
one fire different from another, and whenever they
are of sufficient importance they become the feature
to be played up in the first line of the introduction.
It would be impossible to enumerate all the unexpected
things that might happen during a fire. It is
this element of unexpected possibilities that makes
the reporting of fires interesting, and an alert reporter
is ever on the lookout for a new and unusual
development in the fire to be used as the feature of
his story. Here are the leads of a few fire stories
clipped from the daily newspapers:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
With her home on fire and the smoke
swirling around her head, Mrs. B. B.
Blank, a well-known leader of the social
set of Roland Park, bravely stood
by her telephone and called upon the
Roland Park Fire Company for aid
shortly after 8 o'clock this morning.&mdash;<em>Baltimore
Star.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">

</div>


<p class="c2">C. FIRE STORIES WITH MORE THAN ONE FEATURE</p>

<p>It would appear from the foregoing examples that
almost every fire story has a feature. And so it usually
has. The great majority of fires that are worth
reporting at all have some unusual incident connected
with them that overshadows the mere fire
itself. Sometimes the features are not of great
significance, but it is only as a last resort that a reporter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
begins his story with "Fire"&mdash;only when the
most ordinary of fires is to be covered.</p>

<p>Unusual features are so common in connection
with fires that very often a single fire has more than
one unusual feature. Perhaps the cause of the fire
is exceptionally striking and at the same time the
amount of property destroyed is of great news value
in itself. Or the time and some unexpected attendant
circumstance are both worth the first place. In
that case the reporter has to choose between the two
features and begin with the one that seems to him
to be the more striking. The other feature or features
may often be arranged in the order of importance
immediately after the most striking fact at
the beginning, provided that this does not make the
lead unduly complicated.</p>

<p>For instance, a cold storage warehouse burns and
four firemen are overcome by the fumes from the
ammonia pipes. Next door is a hospital and the
flames frighten the patients almost into a panic.
Either one of these incidents is worth the first line
of the story. But which one is of the greater importance?
Naturally the element of danger to human
life must be considered first and the actual disabling
of four firemen is of greater significance than
a possible panic in the hospital. Following that line
of logic our story would begin:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Four firemen were overcome by ammonia
fumes and a panic in the St.
Charles Hospital was narrowly averted,
as a result of a fire which destroyed
the cold storage warehouse of, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Such a lead would not be too complicated for
practical purposes. But suppose that around the
corner from the cold storage warehouse is a livery
in which fifty horses are stabled. The flames
frighten the horses and they break loose and stampede
in the streets. The story now has three features
of striking interest. It would be possible to
combine them all in the lead and to begin in this
way:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Four firemen were overcome by ammonia
fumes, a panic was narrowly
averted in the St. Charles Hospital, and
fifty frightened horses stampeded in the
streets as a result of a fire, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>But see how far from the beginning the fire, the
actual cause of it all, is placed. The fire is buried
behind a mass of details and the reader is confused.
The lead is not a happy one. The only thing to do
is to break up the mass of details and put part of
them immediately after the lead. The arrangement
is a matter that must be left to the judgment of the
reporter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>This, however, is an extreme case because the various
features are so disconnected and separate. The
reporter would have little trouble if the several features
were more alike. For instance, if one of the
walls of the building had fallen and killed three firemen
the case would have been simpler. The death
of these men so far overshadows the other unusual
incidents that it drives them out of the lead altogether.
For we do not care about horses and frightened
patients when men are crushed beneath falling
walls. All that we are concerned with in our lead
now is the dead and injured&mdash;with a feature like
this we can trust our readers to go into the story far
enough to pick up the other interesting features; we
would begin in this way:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Three firemen were killed by falling
walls and four others were overcome by
ammonia fumes in a fire which destroyed
the cold storage, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>The combination of dead and injured makes a
good beginning, and it is always advisable to begin
with such an enumeration whenever it is possible.
Where the features are not so significant as death
and injuries the matter of arranging more than one
striking detail at the beginning of the lead becomes
a greater problem. It must be left to one's own
judgment and common sense. The lead must not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
too long or complicated, and one must hesitate before
burying the really important facts of the story
behind several lines of more or less unusual details.
Just as soon as the lead becomes at all confusing take
out the details and put them into the story later.</p>

<br />
<small>FAULTS IN NEWS STORIES</small></h2>


<p>Before we go on to the consideration of other
kinds of news stories it will be well to consider in
greater detail the facts we have learned from writing
up fires. Our fire stories should have taught us a
number of things about the form of the news story.
Let us sum them up.</p>

<p><b>Paragraph Length.</b>&mdash;We have seen that newspaper
writing has a characteristic style of its own. In
the first place notice the length of a newspaper paragraph.
Count the number of words in an average
paragraph and compare it with the number of words
in a literary paragraph. We find that the newspaper
paragraph is much shorter. There is a reason for
this. Imagine a 150-word literary paragraph set up
in a newspaper. There are about seven words to
the line in a newspaper column and one hundred and
fifty words would make something over twenty lines.
Try to picture a newspaper made up of twenty-line
paragraphs; it would be extremely difficult to read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
We glance over a newspaper hastily and our haste
requires many breaks to help us in gathering the
facts. Hence the paragraphs must be short; the very
narrowness of the newspaper column causes them to
be shortened. The average lead, you will find, contains
less than fifty words and the paragraphs following
it are not much longer.</p>

<p><b>Sentence Length.</b>&mdash;Notice sentence lengths as compared
with literary sentences. You will find that
newspaper sentences usually fall into two classes: the
sentences in the lead and the sentences in the body
of the story. The first sentence is usually rather
long&mdash;thirty to sixty words. But the sentences in
the body of the story are much shorter than most
literary sentences. Why is this? It results from
exactly the same thing that makes the newspaper
paragraphs short&mdash;the need of many breaks. Thus,
after we finish a lead, we must fall into short sentences.
They need not be choppy sentences, but they
must be simple and easy to read.</p>


<p class="c2">THE LEAD AND THE BODY OF THE STORY</p>

<p>Our study of the fire story has shown that newspaper
stories always have two separate and distinct
parts: the lead and the body of the story. In writing
the story a reporter must consider each part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
separately, although the reader does not distinguish
between the two parts. Before writing a word the
reporter must decide exactly what facts and details
he is to put in the lead and exactly what fact he is
going to play up in the first line, taking care to begin
with the most interesting part of the story.
After the lead is finished he writes the main body of
the story in accordance with the rules of ordinary
English composition. Each part must be separate
and independent of the other.</p>

<p><b>The Lead.</b>&mdash;The lead itself is always paragraphed
separately. Usually it consists of a single sentence,
although it is much better to break it into two than
to make the sentence too long and complicated. As
we have said before, the lead must not only tell the
most interesting fact or incident in the story, but it
must answer the natural questions that the reader
immediately asks about this matter; i.e., when,
where, what, why, who, and how. These questions
must be answered briefly and concisely in their order
of importance, and the most unusual answer or the
most striking part of the story must precede all the
rest. Beyond the answers to these questions there
is no space for details in the lead. Every word must
have a purpose and a necessary purpose or it must
be cut out and relegated to the body of the story.
No space should be given to explanations of minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
importance. State the content of the news story as
completely, accurately, and concisely as possible so
that the reader may know just what happened, when
it happened, where, to whom, and perhaps how and
why it happened. Then begin a new paragraph and
start the body of the story.</p>

<p>Many editors require that the lead consist of one
long sentence and yet it must be grammatical.
Many reporters forget all about English grammar
in their attempt to crowd everything they know into
one sentence. But mere quantity does not make the
lead good; it must be grammatical and easy to read.
The verb must have a grammatical subject and, if it
is an <em>active</em> verb, it must have a grammatical predicate.
Clauses and modifiers must be attached in a
way that cannot be overlooked. Dangling participles
and absolute constructions should be shunned.
All of the modifying clauses must be gathered together
either before or after the principal clause.
Everything must be compact and logical. Many papers
disregard this matter, as will be seen in some
of the extracts quoted in this book, but the best
papers do not.</p>

<p>Every lead should be so constructed that it may
stand alone and be self-sufficient. Never should a
reporter trust to headlines to enlighten his readers
upon the meaning of the lead&mdash;the exact reverse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
this must be true. The story is written first and the
headlines are written from the facts contained in
the lead&mdash;and usually by another man. In writing
the lead disregard the existence of headlines, for
many readers do not read them at all. This is but
an amplification of the old rule of composition that
any piece of writing should be independent of its
title. The title may be lost, but the essay must be
clear without it.</p>

<p>There are many ways of beginning a lead in order
to embody the feature in the first line. At first
glance the operation of putting the emphasis of a
sentence at the beginning, rather than at the end,
may seem difficult, but with a clear idea of the rules
of dependence in English grammar a reporter may
transpose any clause to the beginning and thus play
up the content of the clause. For instance, in this
lead,</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire, starting in a moving picture theatre,
4418 Third avenue, drove the tenants
of the building out into the icy
street while the snowstorm was at its
height shortly before 12 o'clock last
night.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">the striking feature of the story is buried&mdash;we do
not get the unusual picture of a little group of people
shivering in the street during a blinding snowstorm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
while they watch their homes burn. A simple
transposition of the <em>while</em>-clause puts the feature in
the first line. Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">While the snowstorm was at its
height shortly before 12 o'clock last
night, fire, starting in a moving picture
theatre, 4418 Third avenue, drove the
tenants of the building out into the
icy street.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The lead is not perfect now; it might be greatly improved,
but it is better than before.</p>

<p>A few of the possible beginnings for a lead are:</p>

<p>1. <em>Noun.</em>&mdash;The simplest beginning of a lead is of
course the use of a noun as subject of the principal
verb. For example, "Fire destroyed the residence
of&mdash;&mdash;" or "A flashlight setting fire to a lace curtain
started a fire&mdash;&mdash;" or "The Plaza Hotel had a
few uncomfortable moments last night&mdash;&mdash;" etc.
The subject of the verb may of course have its modifiers&mdash;adjectives
and phrases&mdash;but it should not be
separated too widely from its verb. One point is to
be noted in the use of a simple noun at the beginning;
an article should not precede the noun if it can
be avoided, for the very simple reason that an article
is not worth the important space that it takes at the
beginning of the lead. In the case of fire no article
is necessary. In other cases it is usually possible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
put in an adjective or some other word that will take
the article's place. However, never begin a story
like this: "Supreme Court of the United States decided&mdash;&mdash;"
or "Young man in evening dress was
arrested last night&mdash;&mdash;" or "House of John Smith
was destroyed yesterday&mdash;&mdash;". Obviously something
is lacking and, if no other word will supply the
lack, use the article, <em>the</em> or <em>a</em>. When the <em>noun</em>-beginning
is used the reporter must never forget that
two or more nouns, however different, if subject of
the same verb, require a plural verb. The verb may
be active or passive, whichever is more convenient,
but rarely is the object of an active verb put first&mdash;simply
because English cannot bear this transposition
of subject and predicate.</p>

<p>2. <em>Infinitive.</em>&mdash;Other parts of speech aside from
nouns may be subjects of verbs and so other parts
of speech as subjects of the principal verb of the
lead may be placed at the beginning of the lead. An
infinitive with its object and modifier may occupy
the first line as subject of the main verb; e.g.:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">To rescue his own son during the
burning of his own house was a part
of yesterday's work for Fireman Michael
Casey, who, etc.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Here the infinitive "to rescue" and its object are the
subject of the verb "was," and the construction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
perfectly grammatical. Unfortunately the English
language has another infinitive which very much resembles
a present participle&mdash;the infinitive ending
in <em>-ing</em>; e.g., <em>rescuing</em>. Without an article this part
of speech must, of course, be used only as an adjective,
but with an article it becomes an infinitive,
to be treated as a noun; e.g., <em>the rescuing of</em>. It
would be perfectly grammatical to begin the above
lead in this way: "The rescuing of his own son ... was
the work, etc." But it would be ungrammatical
to begin it thus: "Rescuing his own son was the
work, etc." For in the second case the word "rescuing,"
if used with an object, is not an infinitive but a
participle, and must be used only as an adjective,
thus: "Rescuing his own son, Fireman Casey performed
his duty, etc.," or "In rescuing his own son,
Fireman Casey performed his duty." The two uses
should never be confused.</p>

<p>3. <em>Clause.</em>&mdash;Another expression that may be used
as subject of the lead's principal verb is a clause&mdash;usually
a <em>that</em>-clause. For instance, "That the entire
wholesale district was not destroyed by fire last
night is due to, etc." Here the <em>that</em>-clause is subject
of the verb is and the expression is entirely grammatical
as well as very useful as a beginning.</p>

<p>4. <em>Prepositional Phrase.</em>&mdash;When the feature of a
story is an action rather than a thing, a noun can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hardly be used to express it. Very often this lead
may be handled by means of a prepositional phrase
at the beginning. For example, one of the stories
in the last chapter begins: "With her home on fire
and with smoke swirling around her head, Mrs.
John, etc." In this case the prepositional phrase
modifies the subject and should not be far from it.
Another variation of this is the prepositional phrase
of time, modifying the verb; e.g., "During the wedding
of Miss Mary Jones, last night, the house suddenly
caught fire, etc." This beginning is effective
if it is not overworked, but the reader should never
be held back from the real facts of the story by a
string of complicated phrases, intended to build up
suspense.</p>

<p>5. <em>Participial Phrase.</em>&mdash;Very much like the prepositional
phrase beginning is the participial beginning.
"Sliding down an eighty-foot extension ladder
with a woman in his arms, Fireman John Casey
rescued, etc." It must be borne in mind that the
participial phrase must modify a noun and there
should be no doubt in the reader's mind as to the
noun that it modifies. It would of course be absurd
to say "Sliding down an eighty-foot extension ladder,
fire seriously burned John Casey&mdash;&mdash;," but
such things are often said. Never should this participial
phrase be used as the subject of a verb, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"Returning home and finding her house in ashes was
the unusual experience of Mrs. James, etc." The
phrase must always modify a noun just like an adjective.</p>

<p>6. <em>Temporal Clause.</em>&mdash;A feature may often be
brought to the beginning of the lead by a simple
transposition of clauses. Should the time be important
a subordinate <em>when</em> or <em>while</em> clause may precede
the principal clause of the sentence; i.e., "When
the snowstorm was at its height early this morning,
a three-story brick building burned, etc.," or "While
15,000 people watched from the street below, 250
girls escaped from the burning building at, etc."</p>

<p>7. <em>Causal Clause.</em>&mdash;Should the cause of an action
or an occurrence be attractive enough for the first
line, a <em>for</em> or a <em>because</em> clause may begin the lead.
"Because a tinsmith upset a pot of molten solder on
the roof of pier No. 19, two steamers were burned,
etc."</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>This does not exhaust the list of possible beginnings.
There are a dozen possible constructions for
the beginning of any story; these are merely the
commonest ones. Anything unusual or of doubtful
grammar should be avoided because of the many
possible alternatives that present themselves. And
in every lead correct grammar should be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
above all else. If a lead is ungrammatical no clever
arrangement of details can make it effective or other
than ludicrous. For instance, this lead, taken from
a newspaper, illustrates an unfortunate attempt to
crowd too many details into a short lead:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Bitten by a rattlesnake, Myrtle Olson's
leg was slashed with a table knife,
washed the wound with kerosene, then
covered the incision with salt by her
mother. Myrtle still lives.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Another paper tried to arrange it more happily,
thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Bitten by a rattlesnake, Myrtle Olson's
mother slashed her daughter's leg
with a table knife, washed the wound
with kerosene, then covered the incision
with salt. Myrtle still lives.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">There is evidently something wrong in this. It
would be a good exercise to try to express the idea
grammatically.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>Before we go on to the consideration of the body
of this story a few <em>Don'ts</em> in regard to writing leads
may be in order.</p>

<p>Don't begin a lead with a person's name unless
the person is well known. We are always interested
in anything unusual that a man may do or anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
unusual that he may suffer, but unless we know the
man we are not at all interested in his name. Suppose
that a man performs some thrilling act or suffers
some unusual misfortune in a city of 100,000
people. Probably not more than one hundred people
know him, and of that number only one or two will
read the story. Then why begin with his name when
his action is of greater interest to all but a few of
our readers? And yet every reader wants to know
whether the victim is one of his friends. Therefore
the man's name must be mentioned in the lead, although
it should not come at the beginning. On the
other hand, if the man is prominent in the nation or
the community and well known to all our readers, his
name adds interest to the story and we begin with
the name. There is a growing tendency among
American newspapers to begin all of their stories
with a name. The tendency appears to be the result
of an attempt to break away from the conventional
lead and to begin in a more natural way&mdash;also an
easier way. But the name beginning is after all
illogical, and any reporter is safe in following the
logical course in the matter. If the name is not
important begin with something that is important.</p>

<p>Don't waste the main verb of the sentence on a
minor action while expressing the principal action in
a subordinate clause. This is a violation of emphasis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
For example, "Fatally burned by an explosion
in his laundry, Hing Lee was taken to the hospital."
Naturally he would be taken to the hospital, but why
put the emphasis of the whole sentence on that
point?</p>

<p>Don't resort to the expression "was the unusual
experience of&mdash;&mdash;" "was the fate of&mdash;&mdash;" or any
like them. Every word in the lead must count, and
here are five words that say nothing at all. Use their
place to tell what the unusual experience was. For
instance, don't say "To stand in a driving snowstorm
and watch their homes burn to the ground was the
unusual experience of two families, living at, etc.";
say instead, "Standing in a driving snowstorm two
families watched their homes burn to the ground."
The latter says the same thing more effectively in
less space. The use of this expression&mdash;"was the
unusual experience of"&mdash;is always the mark of a
green reporter.</p>

<p>Don't overwork the expression "Fire broke out."
All fires "break out," but usually we are more interested
in the result of the fire than in its "breaking
out." Try to use some expression that will give
more definite information.</p>

<p>Don't be wordy. Editors are always calling for
shorter and more concise leads. If you can say a
thing in two words don't use half a dozen. For example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"Four members of the local fire department
were rendered unconscious by the deadly fumes from
bursting ammonia pipes." This takes three times as
much space as "Four firemen were overcome by ammonia
fumes," and it does not express the idea any
more effectively.</p>

<p>Don't introduce minor details into the lead. If
the reader wants the details he may read the rest of
the story. Take the following lead as an example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Rushing back into his burning laundry,
a one-story brick building, to rescue
from the flames his savings,
amounting to $437, with which he hoped
to raise himself from the rank of laborer
to that of a prosperous merchant,
and which was hidden under the mattress
of his bed in the back room of the
laundry, Hing Lee, a Chinaman, who
lives at 79 Nicollett avenue and has
been in this country but three months,
was overcome by smoke and so seriously
burned that he had to be removed
to the St. Mary Hospital and may not
live, when his establishment was destroyed
by a fire which, starting from
the explosion of the tank of the gasolene
stove on which he was cooking his dinner,
gutted his laundry, entailing a loss
of $1,000, shortly before noon to-day.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">It is entirely grammatical, but if the reader succeeds
in wading through it there is nothing left to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
about the fire. Why not begin the story in this way
and leave something for the rest of the story?</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Because he rushed back into his burning
laundry to rescue his savings, Hing
Lee, a Chinese laundryman, 79 Nicollett
avenue, was seriously burned to-day.</p>
</div>

<p>Don't waste the first line of the lead on meaningless
generalities. Get down to the facts at once.
For instance, "The presence of mind and bravery of
Fireman David Mullen saved Mrs. Daniel Looker
from being burned to death in her flat, etc." We are
willing to grant his bravery and presence of mind,
but we want to know at once what he did: "By
sliding down an eighty-foot extension ladder through
flames and smoke with an unconscious woman in his
arms, Fireman David Mullen rescued Mrs. Daniel,
etc." Equally useless is the beginning, "A daring
rescue of an unconscious woman from the fourth
story of a blazing flat building was made by Fireman
David Mullen to-day, etc." Tell what the daring
rescue was and let the reader manufacture a fitting
eulogy.</p>

<p>Don't exaggerate the facts to make a feature.
When a few persons are frightened don't turn it into
a dreadful panic. Every little fire is not a holocaust
and the burning of a small barn does not endanger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the entire city, unless your imagination is strong
enough to guess what might have happened had
there been a high wind and no fire engines. A narrow
escape from death does not always excuse the
beginning, "Scores killed and injured would have
been the result, <em>if</em>&mdash;&mdash;" All beginnings of this kind
give a false impression and do not tell the truth. If
a story has no striking feature be satisfied to tell the
truth about it without trying to make a world-wide
disaster out of it for the sake of a place on the front
page. Exaggeration for a feature is one of the bad
elements of sensational journalism. For example,
seven lives were lost in this fire, but this is the
way the story was written, for the sake of a three-column
scare-head:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">That 500 sleeping babes and 100 more
who were kneeling in prayer in St.
Malachi's Home, a Roman Catholic institution
for the care of orphans at
Rockaway Park, are alive to-day is due
to the coolness of the nuns in charge
and the children's remembrance of their
teacher's fire drills.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The suspense is built up in such a way that at the
end of the lead we do not know what happened and
read on with breathless interest to find that there
was a small fire at the Home and seven children
were burned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Body of the Story.</b>&mdash;"A good beginning is
half done," according to the proverb. In writing a
news story a good beginning is more than half done&mdash;two-thirds
at least. The lead is the beginning,
and when that has been written we are ready to go
on to the body of the story with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>Our lead has told the reader the main facts of the
case and the most unusual feature. If he reads
further he is looking for details. In giving him these
we return to the ordinary rules of narration. We
start at the very beginning of the story and tell it
logically and in detail to the end. We tell it as
if no lead preceded it and repeat in greater detail the
incidents briefly outlined in the lead. Never should
the body of the story depend upon the lead for clearness.
If the feature of the story is a rescue and you
have briefly described the rescue in the lead, ignore
the lead and describe the rescue all over again in
the body of the story in its proper place. The number
of details that are to be introduced into the story
is limited only by the space that the story seems
to be worth. But no point should be mentioned
in the story unless space permits of its being made
clear.</p>

<p>The ordinary rules of English composition apply
to the writing of the body of the story. The copy
must be paragraphed, cut up into paragraphs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
are rather shorter than ordinary literary paragraphs,
since the narrowness of the newspaper column makes
the paragraph seem longer. Heterogeneous details
must not be piled together in the same paragraph,
but the facts must be grouped and handled logically.
No paragraph should be noticeably longer than the
others, and it is decidedly bad to paragraph one sentence
alone simply because it does not seem to go in
with any other sentence. If the fact is important
expand it into a paragraph by the introduction of
further details; if it is unimportant either cut it out
of the story altogether or attach it to the paragraph
to which it seems most logically to belong.</p>

<p>One fact, already stated, must be borne in mind as
the body of the story progresses. The report should
be built up in such a way that the editor can slash
off a paragraph or two at the end without injuring
the story&mdash;without sacrificing any important facts.
To do this the reporter should bring the important
parts of the story as near the beginning as the logical
order will permit. The interest of a perfect news
story is like an inverted cone. The interest is abundant
at the beginning and gradually dwindles out
until there is nothing more to say when the end is
reached. Just how far the dwindling should be carried
depends upon the amount of space that the story
seems to be worth in the paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>This may seem difficult. It may be hard to see
how a story can be told in its logical order while at
the same time the most interesting facts are placed
at the beginning, even if they logically belong near
the end. For example, we may take the story of an
unusual robbery. A well-dressed man goes into a
grocery store to get some butter and tries to rob the
grocer. In the ensuing scuffle the would-be robber
escapes. A young woman who happens to be passing
sees the end of the fight and pursues the robber
down the street until he runs into a saloon. She
calls a policeman who is standing on the corner and
the officer rushes into the saloon, up three flights of
stairs and finds the robber on the roof behind a
chimney. The officer shouts to another policeman,
and together they arrest the robber.</p>

<p>Now, what is the most interesting thing in the
story? Probably the pursuit&mdash;a young woman chasing
a robber down the street. Our lead might be
written in this way:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">After being chased down Sixth street
by a young woman, a robber, who had
attempted to rob the grocery store of
Charles Young, 1345 Sixth street, was
arrested on the roof of a saloon at 835
Sixth street, at 7 o'clock last night.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The lead might be arranged in a different way, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
these are the facts that it would contain. Before we
consider the arrangement of the body of the story
it may be well to go back to the interviews by which
we secured the story. In getting the facts we would
probably talk to Young, the groceryman, and to the
saloonkeeper into whose establishment the robber
fled. We could probably interview the policeman
who made the arrest, but let us suppose that the
young woman could not be found. The groceryman
would tell us about the attempted robbery and the
escape, with the girl in pursuit. The saloonkeeper
would tell us how the man fled into his saloon and
ran up the stairs to the roof; then how two policemen
came and made the arrest. The policeman could
tell us how a young woman ran up to him and told
him that a robber had fled into the saloon; then he
would describe the arrest. None of these stories is
told just as we want the newspaper story&mdash;each one
tells us only a part of the story. If the finished story
were written by a green reporter it would probably
tell the story in the order in which it was obtained.
That is if the reporter saw the policeman first, then
the saloonkeeper, and lastly the groceryman; his
story would tell in the first paragraph what the policeman
said, in the second paragraph what the
saloonkeeper said, and in the last paragraph what the
grocer said. At least that is the way in which green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
reporters in the classroom attempted to write the
story.</p>

<p>But, obviously, that is not the logical way to tell
the story. The finished account should be written in
the order in which it happened: i.e., first the robbery,
then the pursuit, and lastly the arrest. This would
be the ideal way to tell the story&mdash;according to the
rules of English composition&mdash;if we could be sure
that the entire story would be printed. But if it
were written in this way and the editor decided to
slash off the last paragraph, what would go? Obviously
the arrest would not be printed; and the arrest
was quite interesting. We must find some way
to bring the arrest nearer to the beginning. This
may be done by selecting the most interesting parts
of the story&mdash;by picking out the high spots, as it
were. In this story the high spots are the attempted
robbery, the pursuit, and the arrest. The details
that fill in between are interesting, but not so interesting
as these high spots. Hence these high spots
of interest must be pushed forward toward the beginning.
After the lead the story would begin at the
beginning and tell the affair briefly by high spots in
their proper order. It might be something like this:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">As Charles Young was closing his
grocery last evening a young man came
in and asked for a pound of butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Young turned to get it and his customer
struck him over the head with a
chair. The grocer grappled with his
assailant and they fell through the front
door. In the scramble, the robber broke
away and ran down Sixth street. A
young woman who was passing
screamed and ran after him until he
disappeared into a saloon.</p>

<p class="nt">The young woman called Policeman
Smith, who was standing nearby on
Grand avenue, and the latter found the
would-be robber on the roof of the saloon.
After a struggle, Smith arrested
the man, with the aid of another policeman.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The above account tells us briefly the most interesting
parts of the story. A copyreader might not find
it perfect, for the assault is allotted too much space
and the pursuit too little, but it tells the story in its
baldest aspect. This, with the lead, could be run
alone. However, perhaps the story is worth more
space; at any rate, many interesting details have been
omitted. If so, go back to the most interesting part
of the story&mdash;the assault, perhaps, or the pursuit&mdash;and
tell it with more details. Then retell some other
part with more details. If your readers are interested
enough to read beyond the first three paragraphs
they want details and will not be so particular
about the order&mdash;for they already know how the
story is going to end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
This is one way of meeting the requirements of
logical order and dwindling interest. This is a particularly
hard story to arrange in the conventional
way since we must have the whole story to be interested
in any single part&mdash;it has too many striking incidents
in it. On the other hand, a story which contains
only one striking incident is much easier to
handle. Suppose that we are reporting a fire which
is interesting only for its cause or for a daring rescue
in it. Our lead would suggest this interesting
element and the first part of our story would be devoted
entirely to the cause or to the rescue, as the
case might be. But it is better to sketch briefly, immediately
after or very close to the lead, the entire
story, for our readers want to know how it ends
before they can be interested in any particular part.
If we sketch the whole story and show them that
there is only one important thing in the story, they
will be satisfied to read about the one striking incident
without wondering if there is not something
more interesting further on. If we leave the conclusion
of the story to the end of our copy the editor
may cut it off and leave our story dangling in midair.
Every story must be treated in its own way,
according to its own incidents and difficulties; no
two stories are alike in substance or treatment. In
every one our aim must be to keep to the logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
order and at the same time to put the most interesting
parts of the story near the beginning.</p>

<p>The construction of the body of a story may be
illustrated more clearly by a fatal fire story&mdash;since
fire stories are more uniform, and hence easier to
write than other news stories. Let us suppose that
the story is as follows: At four o'clock in the afternoon
a fire started from some unknown cause in the
basement of a four-story brick building at 383-385
Sixth Street, occupied by the Incandescent Light
Company. Before the fire company arrived the
flames had spread up through the building and into
an adjoining three-story brick building at 381 Sixth
Street, occupied by Isaac Schmidt's second-hand
store and home on the first and second floors and by
Mrs. Sarah Jones's boarding house on the third.
The Schmidts were away and Mrs. Jones's lodgers
escaped via the fire escapes. Her cook, Hilda
Schultz, was overcome by smoke and had to be carried
out by Jack Sweeney, a lodger. Mrs. Jones fell
from the fire escape and was badly bruised. Meanwhile
the firemen were at work on the roof of the
burning four-story building. Blinded by the smoke,
one of them, John MacBane, stepped through a skylight
and fell to the fourth floor. His comrades
tried to rescue him by lowering Fireman Henry
Bond into the smoke by the heels; they were unsuccessful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and Bond broke his arm in the attempt. The
fire was confined to the lower floors of the two buildings
and extinguished. In searching for MacBane,
the firemen found him suffocated on the fourth floor
where he had fallen.</p>

<p>The feature of the story is evidently the one death
and the three injuries. Our lead might be written
as follows:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">One fireman was suffocated and three
other persons were injured in a fire in
the Incandescent Light Company's plant,
383-385 Sixth street, and an adjoining
three-story building, late yesterday afternoon.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">This lead would suggest to the reader many interesting
details to come in the body of the story, and evidently
the details are not all of equal importance.
The story could be told in its logical order, but, since
the death is more interesting than the origin of the
fire and the injuries are more significant than how
the fire spread, it is obvious that it would not be best
to tell the story in the order in which it is told above.</p>

<p>Disregarding the lead, we must cover the following
details in the body of our story:</p>

<ul>
<li>Description of buildings and occupants.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Origin of fire.</li>
<li>Discovery of fire.</li>
<li>Spread of flames.</li>
<li>Injury of Mrs. Jones.</li>
<li>Rescue of Hilda Schultz.</li>
<li>Death of MacBane.</li>
<li>Injury of Bond.</li>
<li>Fire extinguished.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noi">This is the order in which things occurred at the fire.
However, in our lead, we have drawn attention to
our story by announcing that it concerns a fire in
which a man was killed; the death therefore should
have first place in the body of the story. Hence, in
the second paragraph immediately after the lead, we
must tell how MacBane fell through the skylight
and was suffocated. Along with his death we may
as well tell how Bond broke his arm trying to rescue
MacBane. Our lead has also announced two other
injuries and, hence, they must be included next&mdash;that
is, our third paragraph must be devoted to the
injury of Mrs. Jones and the rescue of the unconscious
Hilda. But as yet our details are hanging in
the air because we have not said anything about the
buildings or the fire itself. In the next paragraph
it would be well to describe the buildings and their
occupants and to give a very brief account of the
course of the fire&mdash;perhaps in this way:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Flames were first discovered in the
basement of the Incandescent building
and before the fire department arrived
had spread through the lower floors and
into the adjoining three-story building.
The absence of elevator shafts and air-shafts
enabled the firemen to extinguish
the blaze before it reached the upper
floors.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">This tells the main course of the fire, but there are
some interesting details to add: first, the origin of
the fire; next, the discovery; then more about how
the fire spread; and lastly, how the fire was extinguished.
Our story by paragraphs would read as
follows:</p>

<div class="block2">
<p>1st Paragraph&mdash;The lead.</p>

<p>2d Paragraph&mdash;Death of MacBane and injury of
Bond.</p>

<p>3d Paragraph&mdash;Mrs. Jones's injury and Hilda's
rescue.</p>

<p>4th Paragraph&mdash;Buildings, occupants, brief course
of fire.</p>

<p>5th Paragraph&mdash;Detailed account of origin of the
fire.</p>

<p>6th Paragraph&mdash;How the fire was discovered.</p>

<p>7th Paragraph&mdash;More about the spread and
course of the fire.</p>

<p>8th Paragraph&mdash;How the fire was extinguished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>9th Paragraph&mdash;Loss, insurance, extent of damage.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus, while telling the story almost in its logical
order, we have picked out the high spots of interest
and crowded them to the beginning. Our readers
will get the facts just about as fast as they wish to
read them and in the order in which they wish them.
Our story may be run in nine paragraphs or even
more; or the editor may slash off anything after the
fourth paragraph without taking away any of the
essential facts of the fire. This method of telling
would fulfill all the requirements of an ideal news
story. A similar outline of the facts that any story
must present will often help a reporter to tell his
story as it should be told. After listing the details
he may number them in their order of importance
and check them off as he has told them.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>This idea of throwing the emphasis and interest
to the beginning applies to the individual paragraphs
and sentences of the story, as well. Each paragraph
must begin strongly and display its most interesting
content in the first line. The emphatic part of each
sentence should be the beginning. A glance at any
newspaper column shows why this is necessary.</p>

<p>The body of a news story is the place for the reporter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
skill and style. He is given all the liberties
of ordinary narration and should make the most of
every word. His individual style comes into play
here. If the interest can be increased by a bit of
dialogue the reporter may put it in. If the facts
can be presented more effectively by means of direct
quotation, the words of any one whom the reporter
has interviewed may be of interest. However, these
things must not be overworked because every trick
of writing loses its effectiveness when it is overworked.</p>

<p>Dialogue used only to give facts which might be
told more clearly in simple direct form should seldom
be used. Dialogue in a news story is used only to
color the story and not to reproduce the interviews
by which the facts were obtained. In gathering the
facts of a story it is sometimes necessary to interview
a number of people, but these interviews should
not be quoted in the resulting story. Many a green
reporter tries to give his story character by telling
what the policeman on the corner, the janitor, and a
small boy in the street told him about the incident.
He succeeds only in dragging out the length of his
story and confusing the reader. After all, the purpose
of a newspaper is to give facts&mdash;and the clearer
and the more direct the method the better will be
the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
In striving for clearness and interest a reporter
must remember that one of his greatest assets is concreteness
of expression. Of all forms of composition
newspaper writing possesses probably the greatest
opportunity for definiteness. Facts and events
are its one concern; theories and abstractions are
beyond its range. Hence the more definite and concrete
its presentation of facts, the better will be its
effect. The reporter should never generalize or
present his statements hazily and uncertainly&mdash;a fact
is a fact and must be presented as such. He must
try to avoid such expressions as "several," "many,"
"a few"&mdash;it is usually possible to give the exact
number. He must continually ask himself "how
many?" "what kind?" "exactly when?" "exactly
what?" Expressions like "about a dozen," "about
thirty years old," "about a week ago," "about a
block away," are never so effective as the exact facts
and figures. Definite concrete details make a news
story real and vivid. The real reporter of news is
the one who can see a thing clearly and with every
detail and present it as clearly and distinctly.</p>

<br />
<small>OTHER NEWS STORIES</small></h2>


<p>The fire story is obviously not the only news story
that is printed in a daily newspaper, but a study of
its form gives us a working knowledge of the writing
of other news stories. The fire story is probably
the commonest news story, and it is by far the
easiest story to handle, for its form has become
somewhat standardized. We know just exactly what
our readers want to know about each fire, and within
certain limits all fires, as well as the reports of them,
are very much alike. There is seldom more than
one fact or incident that makes one fire different
from another and that fact we always seize as the
feature of our report. However, the fire story has
been taken only as typical of other news stories.
Now we are ready to study the others, using the fire
story as our model in writing the others.</p>

<p>There is a vast number of other stories that we
must be able to write, and they lack the convenient
uniformity that fires have. Not only does every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
story have a different feature, but it is concerned
with a different kind of happening. One assignment
may call for the report of an explosion, another the
report of a business transaction, and another a murder.
In each one we have to get the facts and choose
the most striking fact as our feature. Never can
we resort to the simple beginning "Fire destroyed,"
but we must find a different beginning for each assignment.</p>

<p>Just as in the fire story, the lead of any news
story is the most important part. It must begin with
the most striking part of the event and answer the
reader's <em>Where?</em> <em>When?</em> <em>How?</em> <em>Why?</em> and <em>Who?</em>
concerning it. All the rules that apply to the fire
lead apply to the lead of any story.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to classify all the news
stories that a newspaper must print. The very zest
of reporting comes from the changing variety of the
work; no two assignments are ever exactly alike&mdash;if
they were only one would be worth printing.
Newspapers themselves make no attempt to classify
the ordinary run of news or to work out a systematic
division of labor; a reporter may be called
upon to cover a fire, a political meeting, a murder, a
business story, all in the same day. Each one is
simply a story and must be covered in the same way
that all the rest are covered&mdash;by many interviews for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
facts. For our study it may be well to divide news
stories into a few large groups. The groups overlap
and are not entirely distinct, but the stories in
each group have some one thing in common that
may aid us in learning how to write them. At most,
the list is only a very incomplete summary of the
more important kinds of news stories and is intended
to be merely a suggestive way of supplying the student
with necessary practice.</p>

<p><b>1. Accidents.</b>&mdash;Accident stories may be anything
from a sprained ankle to a disastrous railroad wreck,
but they all depend upon one element for their interest.
They are all printed because people in general
are interested in the injuries and deaths of other
people&mdash;physical calamity is the common ground in
all these stories.</p>

<p>The number of possible accidents is infinite, but
there are some common types that recur most often.
Among these are: railroad, trolley, railroad crossing
accidents; runaways; electrocutions; explosions; collapse
of buildings; marine disasters; cave-in accidents;
elevator, automobile, aviation accidents.</p>

<p>The feature of any accident story is always, of
course, the thing that made the story worth printing,
and that is usually the human life element. The
feature of an accident story is almost always the
number of dead and injured. Most reports of railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
wrecks begin with "Ten persons were killed and
seventeen were injured in a wreck, etc." The same
is true of any accident story; if more than one person
is killed it is usually safe to begin with the number
of fatalities. In this connection it may be noted
that the death of railroad employees seldom makes
a story worth printing; they may be included in the
total number, but if no passengers are killed, fatalities
among trainmen seldom give a story any news
value.</p>

<p>Accident stories of course have many other possible
features; newspapers report many accidents in
which no one is killed. In that case some other element
gives the story news value and that element
must be played up as the feature. Perhaps it is the
manner in which the accident happened or the manner
in which a person was killed or injured, as in
an automobile accident. The cause of the accident
may be the most interesting part of the story: train-wreckers
or a broken rail in a railroad wreck, or the
cause of an explosion. Very often an accident is reported
simply because some well-known person was
connected with it in some way; the name then becomes
the feature and comes into the first line. A
story may be worth printing simply because of the
unusual manner of rescue; such a feature is often
played up in stories of marine accidents, cave-ins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
etc. Not infrequently some of the unusual attendant
circumstances give a story news value: e.g., a policeman
dragged from his horse and run over by an
automobile while he is trying to stop a runaway.</p>

<p>Here are some accident stories from the newspapers:</p>

<p class="noi nb">Fatalities:</p>

<div class="block nt nb">

Tenth street, between Chestnut street
and Cold Spring avenue, exploded at
about 4 o'clock this morning.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>2. Robberies.</b>&mdash;Another large class of news
stories is concerned with robberies of various kinds.
Unfortunately for the reporter, very few robberies
are alike; beyond the common ground of the interest
in the amount stolen and the cleverness of the robber's
work, there is seldom any one thing that may
be looked for as the feature of a robbery story. The
reporter must decide what in the story makes it
worth printing.</p>

<p>Robbery stories may include anything from petty
thievery to bank defaulting. Some of the possibilities
are horse and automobile stealing, burglary,
hold-ups, train and street-car robbery, embezzlement,
fraud, kidnapping, safe-cracking, shop and bank robbery.
It is well for the reporter who has to cover
a story of this class to acquaint himself with the
distinctions that characterize the various kinds of
robbery and the various names applied to the people
who commit this sort of crime: e.g., robber, thief,
bandit, burglar, hold-up man, thug, embezzler, defaulter,
safe-cracker, pick-pocket.</p>

<p>In general the chief interest in robbery stories is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in the result of the work&mdash;the amount taken&mdash;usually
accompanied by a term to designate the sort of
robbery. Just how the crime was committed is often
the feature, as in a train robbery or a clever case of
fraud. If the victim or victims are at all well known
their names may become the most interesting thing
in the story&mdash;or even the name of a well-known
criminal or band of robbers. In some stories, especially
if another paper has already covered the story,
the pursuit or capture of the criminals is often interesting;
the stories of bank robberies often begin in
this way. Other attendant circumstances, such as
the number of persons who witnessed the crime, may
be the feature. In hold-ups, burglaries, and crimes
of that sort, the death or wounding of the victim is
often played up. Sometimes the reason for the
crime, as in a kidnapping case, is of great significance.
In the case of a robbery of a bank or any
other institution which depends upon credit for
its business, the story usually begins with, or
at least mentions near the beginning, the present
condition of the robbed institution. It is safe
to say that in no case is the name of the criminal,
the manner of his arrest (if it is not unusual),
the police station to which he was taken, or the
charge preferred against him worth a place in the
lead.</p>

</div>

<p><b>3. Murder.</b>&mdash;The reports of crimes of this sort can
hardly be classified, for there are so many things
that may be worth featuring in any murder case.
The story itself is usually of such importance that
the mere fact that a murder has been committed
gives it news value even if there is nothing unusual
in the crime&mdash;just as in the case of a featureless fire
story that begins with "Fire." The handling of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
crime depends upon the character and circumstances;
the reporter must weigh the facts in each case for
himself. However, we usually find a feature in the
number of persons murdered, the manner in which
the crime was committed, the name of the victim, if
he or she is well known, the reason for the deed, or
in some of the many attendant circumstances, such as
arrest, pursuit, etc. One rule must always be followed
in the reporting of a murder story: the reporter
must confine himself to the necessary facts
and omit as many of the gruesome details as possible.
He must tell it in a cold, hard-hearted way
without elaboration, for the story in itself is gruesome
enough. Just as soon as a murder story begins
to expand upon shocking details it becomes the
worst sort of a yellow story.</p>

to death of a Jersey City business
man in the Pennsylvania Railroad station
there this afternoon.&mdash;<em>New York
Mail.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>4. Suicide.</b>&mdash;What is true of murder stories is also
true of suicide. Each individual case has an unusual
feature of its own. We ordinarily find a good beginning
in the manner of the suicide, the name of
the person who has killed himself if he is well known,
the reason for the act, or some one of the attendant
circumstances&mdash;often the manner of resuscitation if
the crime is unsuccessful. For some unexplained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
reason many papers do not print accounts of ordinary
suicides, except when the individual is prominent.
At any rate the story must be told without
gruesome details and as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>Examples from the press:</p>

<p class="noi nt nb">Name:</p>

<div class="block nt nb">
<p class="nt nb">William L. Murray of Rockview avenue,
North Plainfield, paying teller of
the Empire Trust Company of New
York, committed suicide at Scotch
Plains early this afternoon by shooting
himself in the head. No reason is assigned
for the act.&mdash;<em>New York Sun.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi nt nb">Motive:</p>

<div class="block nt">
<p class="nt nb">Driven insane by continued brooding
over ill health, Miss Ada Emerson, a
former teacher in the Beloit city schools,
killed herself in a crowded interurban
car Saturday afternoon by slashing her
throat with a razor.&mdash;<em>Beloit Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Here the manner is the feature, but it is not played
up in the first line because it is too horrible.</p>

<p><b>5. Big Stories.</b>&mdash;The big stories of catastrophes
are usually handled on a large scale&mdash;played up, as
the newspaper men say. The story in itself is of
sufficient importance to make it unnecessary to play
up any single feature of the story. However, the
reporter, in looking for a good beginning, often
finds it in the most startling fact in the story. If
he is reporting a riot he usually begins with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
number of killed or injured, the amount of property
destroyed, the character of the riot, or the cause, as
in this example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">In an effort to bring about the reinstatement
of one of their number who
had been discharged for non-unionism,
a hundred or more journeymen bakers
wrecked the bakeshop of Pincus Jacobs,
at No. 1571 Lexington avenue, early
this morning.&mdash;<em>New York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p>In the case of a storm the human life element is
of greatest importance, then the damage to property,
and last, the peculiar circumstances. For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">CLEVELAND, Dec. 11.&mdash;Fifty-nine
lives were the cost of a storm which
passed over Lake Erie Wednesday night
and Thursday, and more than $1,000,000
worth of vessel property was destroyed.&mdash;<em>New
York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p>If the story is concerned with a flood the human-life
element is first, then the damage, the cause, the
freaks of the flood, or the present situation. For
example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">PARKERSBURG, W. Va., March 10.&mdash;Three
persons are known to have perished
in a flood which swept down upon
the city on Friday when two water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
reservoirs on Prospect Hill burst without
warning. Forty houses were destroyed
and many persons are missing.
The property damage will be nearly
$500,000.</p>
</div>

<p><b>6. Police Court News.</b>&mdash;The ordinary run of police
court news is in a class by itself. Usually the only
news value in the story depends upon some unusual
incident or circumstance that attracts the attention
of the reporter. This is of course the source of
many of the stories of crime, mentioned before, but
many stories turn up at the police courts which are
not concerned with crime, although in some cases
they are concerned with criminals. In this field of
reporting there are many opportunities for the human-interest
story which will be taken up in a later
chapter. When the incident is reported in an ordinary
news story the feature is usually in some attendant
circumstance and the story might well be
classed with one of the above groups. Here are two
examples from the daily press:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Because he did not have sufficient
money to buy flowers for his sweetheart,
Henry Trupke, aged 21 years, forged
a check for $22.50 on a grocer, J. Sieberlich,
781 Third street, and after a
week's chase was caught last night as
he got off a Wisconsin Central train.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
But a few hours before receiving a
sentence of two years in the house of
correction for stealing furs from the
store of Lohse Bros., 117 Wisconsin
street, John Garner, self-confessed thief,
was married to Rose Strean, one of the
witnesses in the case, which was tried
yesterday in the municipal court.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>7. Reports of Meetings, Conferences, Decisions, etc.</b>&mdash;This
group includes all reports of meetings, or
conferences, of bodies of any sort, political or otherwise,
reports of judicial or legislative hearings or
decisions, or announcements of resolutions passed.
Such as:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">WASHINGTON, Jan. 15.&mdash;Acquisition
of the telegraph lines by the government
and their operation as a part
of the postal system is the latest idea
of Postmaster General Hitchcock. Announcement
was made today that a resolution
to this effect will be offered to
Congress at the present session.&mdash;<em>Wisconsin
State Journal.</em></p>
</div>

<p>There is always one thing in these stories that
gives them news value&mdash;the purpose or result of the
conference, hearing, or announcement. This purpose
or result, of course, must be played up. The
one point that the reporter should remember is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a well-written lead begins with the result or purpose
of the meeting or announcement rather than with
the name of the meeting or the name of the body
that makes the announcement. Never begin a story
thus: "At a meeting of the Press Club held in the
Auditorium last night it was resolved that&mdash;&mdash;"
Transpose the sentence and begin with a statement
of what was resolved. In the following story the
order is wrong:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The Supreme Court of the United
States, through the opinion delivered by
Justice Vandevanter, today declared constitutional
the employers' liability law
of 1908.</p>
</div>

<p>The import of the decision is buried; it should
be written thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The employers' liability law of 1908
was today declared constitutional by the
Supreme Court of the United States.
Justice Vandevanter delivered the opinion
of the court, made in four cases.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">In these stories, as in all other news stories, the lead
must begin with the fact or statement that gives the
story news value. Burying this fact or statement
behind two or three lines of explanation spoils the
effectiveness of the lead. A student of journalism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
may gain very good practice in the writing of news
stories by looking over the leads that appear in
the daily papers and transposing those leads which
bury their news behind explanations. The first
line of type in a lead is like a shop's show window
and it must not be used for the display of packing
cases.</p>

<p><b>8. Stories on Other Printed Matter.</b>&mdash;A large part
of a newspaper's space, especially in smaller cities, is
devoted to stories based on printed bulletins, announcements,
city directories, legislative bills, and
published reports of various kinds. Sometimes a
news story is written upon a pamphlet that was
issued for advertising purposes&mdash;because there is
some news in it. In all of these stories the reporter
must look through the pamphlet to find something of
news value or something that has a significant relation
to other news. Smaller papers often print
stories on the new city directory; the increase or decrease
in population is treated as news and a very
interesting story may be written on a comparison
of the names in the directory. In university towns
the appearance of a new university catalog or bulletin
of any sort is the occasion for a story which
points out the new features or compares the new bulletin
with a previous one. Reporters and correspondents
in political centers, like state capitals, get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
out stories on committee and legislative reports and
on new bills that are proposed or passed by the legislature.
The writing of these stories is very much
like the reporting of a speech, which will be discussed
later. The newest or most interesting feature
in the report or bill is played up in the lead as the
feature of the story, followed by the source of the
story, the printed bulletin upon which the story is
based; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">A new plan for placing the control of
all water power in the state in the hands
of the legislature was proposed in the
minority report of Senators J. B. Smith
and L. C. Blake, of the special legislative
committee on drainage, issued today.</p>
</div>

<p>These eight classes of news stories do not include
all the news stories that a newspaper prints, but they
are in a way typical of all the others that are not
mentioned. It will be noted from these that all
news stories, just like the fire story, are usually written
in about the same way. Each one has a lead
which begins with the feature of the story&mdash;i.e., the
fact or incident in the story which gives it news
value and makes it of interest&mdash;and concludes by
answering the reader's questions, when, where, who,
how, why, concerning the feature. Each story begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
again after the lead, and in one or more paragraphs
explains, describes, or narrates the incident
in detail and in logical order. This body of the
story which follows the lead, while following in
general the logical order, is so written that its most
interesting facts are near the beginning and its interest
dwindles away toward the end. This is to
enable the editor in making up his paper, to take
away from the end of any story, as we have seen
before, a paragraph or more without spoiling the
story's continuity or depriving it of any of its essential
facts. The form of the conventional fire story
may be used as a model in the writing of any news
story.</p>

<p>In writing the body of a story to explain, describe,
or narrate the incident mentioned in the lead, every
effort should be directed toward clearness. This is
particularly true of stories which are in the main
narrations of action. The number of facts that may
be included must depend upon the length of the
story; if all of the facts cannot be included without
overburdening the story, cut out some of the details
of lesser importance, but treat those that are included
in a clear readable way. Short sentences are
always much better in newspaper writing than long
involved sentences. Pronouns should always be
used in such a way that there can be no doubt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
regard to their antecedents. If a relative clause or
participial expression sounds awkward make a separate
sentence of it. In other words, be simple, concise,
and clear&mdash;that is better in a newspaper than
much fine writing.</p>

<br />
<small>FOLLOW-UP AND REWRITE STORIES</small></h2>


<p>The terms "rewrite story" and "follow-up, or follow,
story," are names which newspaper men apply
to the rehashed or revised versions of other news
stories. A large newspaper office employs one or
more rewrite men who spend their entire time rewriting
stories. To be sure, a part of their work
consists of rewriting, or simply recasting, poorly
written copy prepared by the reporters. But the
major part of their work, the part that interests us,
involves something more than that. It involves the
rejuvenation of stories that have been printed in a
previous edition or in another paper, with the purpose
of bringing the news up to the present moment.</p>

<p>News ages very rapidly. What may be news for
one edition is no longer news when another edition
goes to press an hour later. A feature that may be
worth playing up in a morning paper would not have
the same news value in an evening paper of the
same day. The news grows stale so quickly because
new things are continually happening and new developments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
are continually changing the aspect of
previous stories. If a story has been run through
two or three editions and new developments have
changed it, the story is turned over to a rewrite man
for consequent alteration. A story in a morning
paper is no longer news for an evening paper of the
same date, but a clever rewrite man, with or without
new developments added to the story, can recast it
so that it will appear to contain more recent news
than the original story. The story of an arrest in
a morning paper begins with the particulars of the
arrest; but when the evening paper's rewrite man
has rearranged it for his paper it has become the
story of the trial or the police court hearing which
followed the arrest. Perhaps the evening paper
sends a man to get the later developments in the
case, but every rewrite man knows the steps that
always follow an arrest and he can rewrite the original
story without additional information. His
account of the later developments is called either a
rewrite or a follow-up story, depending upon the
method employed. The same fundamental idea of
rejuvenating the former story governs the preparation
of both the rewrite and the follow-up story, but
while the rewrite story contains no additional news,
the follow-up presents later facts in addition to the
old news.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. The Rewrite Story.</b>&mdash;The rewrite story is primarily
a rehashing of a previous news story without
additional facts. It attempts to give a new twist to
old facts in order to bring them nearer to the present
time. Without the aid of later facts the rewrite man
can only select a new feature and revise the old facts.
For example, suppose that a $100,000 grain elevator
burns during the night. The fire would make a big
story in a city of moderate size and the papers next
morning would treat it at length. If no one were
killed or injured the story would probably begin
with a simple announcement of the fire in a lead of
this kind:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire destroyed the grain elevator of
the H. P. Jones Produce Company,
First and Water streets, and $50,000
worth of wheat at 2 o'clock this morning.
The total loss is estimated at
$150,000.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Then the reporter would describe the fire at length,
including all obtainable facts. By afternoon almost
every one in the city has read the story&mdash;and yet the
afternoon papers must print something about the big
fire. If no new facts can be obtained the previous
story must be rehashed and presented with a new
feature that will make it appear to be a later story.
It is useless to begin the evening story with a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
announcement of the fire, for that is no longer news,
and the rewrite man must find a new beginning to
attract the attention of his readers. Perhaps in
looking over the morning story, he finds that the
fire was the result of spontaneous combustion in the
grain stored in the elevator. In the morning story
this fact was rather insignificant in the face of the
huge loss, and most readers passed over it hastily.
The rewrite man, however, who has no later facts at
his command, may seize it as a new feature. Instead
of beginning his story with the fact of the fire, which
is already known, he begins with the cause, which
appears to be later news. His lead may be as follows:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Spontaneous combustion in the wheat
bins of the H. P. Jones Produce Company's
elevator, First and Water streets,
started the fire which destroyed the
entire structure with a loss of $150,000
this morning.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Or if the rewrite man is not so fortunate as to discover
a new feature as good as this, he may have to
resort to beginning with a picture of the present results
of the fire&mdash;thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Smouldering ruins and a tangled mass
of steel beams are all that remain of
the H. P. Jones Produce Company's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
$100,000 grain elevator, First and Water
streets, which was destroyed by fire
this morning.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that, while these new rewrite
leads begin with a new feature, each new lead contains
all the facts presented in the previous lead and
is told with an eye to the man who has not read the
earlier account. After the lead the rewrite man
retells the whole story for the benefit of readers who
did not see the morning papers and rearranges the
facts so that they appear new to those who read the
previous stories. Facts which the other papers buried
he unearths and displays; details which appear
to be later developments he crowds to the beginning.
The whole story is sorted and rewritten in a new
order and with a new emphasis. The result is a
rewrite story which appears to be later, although it
contains no new facts at all. It is seldom, of course,
that such a rewrite story is used for local news, for
very rarely is it impossible for a later paper to discover
new facts. But in the case of news from the
outside world, from other cities, the simple method
of rehashing old facts must often be resorted to. If
the story is based upon a single dispatch announcing
an earthquake in Hawaii or a shipwreck in mid-ocean,
many rewrite stories must be printed on the
same facts before another message brings later news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and additional details. An example of this is the
treatment of the first few stories of the wreck of
the White Star liner <em>Titanic</em>. The story was a big
one, but the first dispatches were very meager and
many rehashings of these few facts had to be printed
before later and more definite news could be obtained.</p>

<p>The simple rewriting of an old story ordinarily
involves a condensation of the facts. If a morning
paper printed two thousand words on the grain
elevator fire above, an afternoon paper of the same
day would hardly treat the story at such length.
For the story is no longer big news. If a story has
run through the first editions of a morning paper it
would be cut down, as well as rehashed, in the later
editions of the same paper. The story of the fire
loses its initial burst of interest after the first printing,
and only the essential facts and the facts
that can be rejuvenated can be reprinted.
The 2,000-word version in the morning paper may
be worth only five hundred words or less four hours
later.</p>

<p><b>2. The Follow-up Story.</b>&mdash;If new facts are added to
a story between editions the new version is no longer
a simple rewrite story. It becomes a follow-up
story, for it follows up the subsequent developments
in the previous story and corresponds to the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
or succeeding installments of a serial novel in which
each installment begins with a synopsis of previous
chapters. For example, if, in the grain elevator fire
story, the body of a watchman were found in the
ruins after the morning papers have gone to press,
the story would immediately have a different news
value for the evening papers. The story of the big
fire is old, but the discovery of the body is new.
Hence the rewrite man would begin with the later
development&mdash;perhaps thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The body of a watchman was found
this afternoon in the ruins of the H. P.
Jones Produce elevator, which burned
to the ground this morning with a loss
of $150,000.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The new story, while retelling the principal facts in
the previous account, would give prominence to the
latest news, the discovery of the body. As an example
from a newspaper, let us take the follow-up
of a murder mystery. The first stories on this murder
simply said that a grocer had been found dead
in the cellar of his store and murder had been suggested.
The follow-up on the next day (printed
here) deals with a new development&mdash;has a new
feature&mdash;and carries the story one step further in
the attempt to unravel the mystery:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Developments yesterday in the story
of the killing of James White, the Park
street grocer, tended to support the contention
of Coroner Donalds and the police
that White was not murdered, but
died by his own hand.</p>
</div>

<p><b>3. Analysis.</b>&mdash;So far we have treated the rewrite
story and the follow-up story separately, but
for the purposes of analysis and study they may
be treated together, because the same fundamental
idea governs both. Dissection of the follow-up
story will also show us what the rewrite story is
made of.</p>

<p>From the above clippings it will be seen that the
lead of the follow-up story is very much like that
of any news story. The lead has its feature in the
first line and answers the reader's questions concerning
that feature. It is simply a new story written on
an old subject which has been given a new feature
to make it appear new. Furthermore, it will be noticed
that the lead of the follow-up story is complete
in itself, without the original story that preceded
it. Although the whole idea of the follow
story is based on the supposition that all readers
have read every edition of the paper and are therefore
acquainted with the original story, yet for the
benefit of those readers who have not read the previous
story, the follow-up must be complete and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
clear in itself. New facts are introduced into the
follow story, but its lead tells the main facts of the
original story so that no reader will be at loss to
understand what it is all about&mdash;in other words, it
gives a synopsis of previous chapters. In many follow-up
stories the new developments are supplemented
by an entire retelling of the original story.
This is especially true when one paper is rewriting a
story which broke too late for its preceding edition
and was covered by a rival paper. At any rate,
every follow-up story, like every other news story,
must be so constructed as to stand by itself without
previous explanation.</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Of the 142 bodies of victims of the
Triangle Waist Company's fire on Saturday,
that had been taken to the
morgue up to noon yesterday when it
was decided that all the dead had been
recovered, all but 45 had been identified
today.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a follow-up of a story two days before.
Every reader of the paper probably knew everything
that had been printed previously about the fire, and
yet this lead very carefully recalls the fire to the
reader's mind. Later in the story the principal facts
of the original story are retold as if they were new
and unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It is interesting to see what in any given newspaper
story can be followed up for a later story.
The would-be reporter may get good practice in
writing follow-up stories from the mere attempt to
study out the next step in any given new story.
With this next step as his feature he may try to
write a follow-up story without additional information,
and then compare it with other follow-up
stories. For every news story contains within it
clues to what may be expected to follow.</p>

<p>When any serious fire occurs certain additional
facts may always be expected to follow. The finding
of more dead, the unravelling of a mysterious
origin, the re-statement of the loss, and the present
condition of the injured are some of the possibilities
that a rewrite man considers when he tries to
prepare a follow-up story on a fire. The Washington
Place fire in New York on March 25, 1911, furnished
admirable material for the study of the rewriting
of fire stories. The fire occurred on Saturday
afternoon too late for anything but the Sunday
editions. The original story as it appeared in the
Sunday papers and the Monday issues, of papers
which had no Sunday editions, began like this:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">One hundred and forty-one persons
are dead as a result of a fire which on
Saturday afternoon swept the three upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
floors of the factory loft building
at the northwest corner of Washington
place and Greene street. More than
three-quarters of this number are women
and girls, who were employed in
the Triangle Shirt Waist factory, where
the fire originated.&mdash;<em>Boston Transcript,
Monday.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The Monday stories on the fire followed up various
phases as shown in the following. Each one
while indicating that the story was a follow-up retold
the principal incidents in the fire.</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The death list in the Washington
place and Greene street fire was swelled
today to 145, a majority of the victims
being young girls.&mdash;<em>Monday morning&mdash;second
story.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block nt">
<p class="nt nb">At dawn today it was estimated that
25,000 persons had visited the temporary
morgue on the covered pier at the foot
of East Twenty-sixth street, set aside
to receive the bodies of those who perished
in the Washington place fire on
Saturday afternoon.&mdash;<em>Monday morning&mdash;second
story.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block nt">
<p class="nt nb">The horror of the fire in the ten-story
loft building at Washington place
and Greene street late Saturday afternoon,
with its heavy toll of human lives,
grows blacker each succeeding hour.&mdash;<em>Monday

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="block nt">
<p class="nt nb">Of the 142 bodies in the morgue as a
result of the Triangle Shirt Waist factory
fire, all but fifty had been identified
this morning.&mdash;<em>Monday afternoon.</em></p>
</div>

<p>On Tuesday other lines opened up for the rewrite
man:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Sifting down the great mass of testimony
at their disposal, city and county
officials hoped today to draw closer to
the source of responsibility for Saturday's
factory fire horror in which 142

started yesterday.&mdash;<em>Tuesday afternoon.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block nt">
<p class="nt nb">With all but twenty-eight of the victims
of the Triangle Shirt Waist factory
horror identified, District Attorney
Whitman continues steadily compiling
evidence. Funerals for scores of victims
are being held today, while the relief

</div>

<div class="block nt">
<p class="nt nb">Borough President McAneny of Manhattan,
the district attorney's staff, the
fire marshal, the coroner and the state
labor department are bending every energy
toward fixing the blame for the loss
of the 142 lives in the, etc.&mdash;<em>Tuesday
afternoon.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block nt">
<p class="nt nb">Union labor, horrified by the full
realization that the waste of human life
in the Triangle Waist factory fire might

enforced, today arranged for a monster
demonstration of protest, etc.&mdash;<em>Tuesday
afternoon.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
And so the stories ran for many days until newspaper
readers had lost all interest in the fire. Most
of the stories were simply retellings of the original
story with a new bit of information in the lead.
People were ravenous for more details about the
fire and the follow stories supplied them until they
were satisfied. Rarely is a fire worth so many retellings.</p>

<p>A serious accident is often followed up in one or
more editions. If many people are killed or injured,
the revised list of dead or the present condition of
the injured always furnishes material for a follow-up.
Sometimes the fixing of the blame, as in a railroad
accident, or other resulting features are used as
the basis of the rewriting.</p>

<p>In the case of a robbery the commonest material
for a follow-up story is the resulting pursuit or capture.
Very often a final report of the loss, the present
condition of a robbed bank or public institution,
or perhaps the regaining of the booty, makes a feature
for a new story. But usually the follow-up is
concerned with the pursuit, capture, or trial. This
is especially true if the original story has been told
by an earlier paper and another later paper wishes
to print a more up-to-date story on the robbery,
such as:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
MINOCQUA, Wis., Oct. 22.&mdash;It now
begins to look as if the bandits who
robbed the State Bank of Minocqua
early Tuesday morning would make
their escape with the booty. (This is
followed by a re-telling of the entire
story of the robbery and an account of
the pursuit.)</p>
</div>

<p>The most usual follow-up of a murder story is
interested in the pursuit, capture, or trial of the perpetrator
of the deed. For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Following the discovery of the body
of Pietro Barilla, an Italian, of Woodhaven,
Long Island, who was stabbed
to death by four men, presumably Black
Hand members, in Lincoln Road, near
Flatbush, early yesterday morning, the
police arrested three men yesterday.</p>
</div>

<p>Very often the present condition of the victim of
an attempted murder calls for a new story. The
stories following the attempted murder of Mayor
Gaynor of New York are good examples of the latter.
If a mystery surrounds the crime a possible
solution is grounds for a new story. The stories
which might follow the unraveling of the mystery
surrounding the fictitious death of the grocer, mentioned
at the beginning of this chapter, would be
second-day murder stories. The original story, let
us say, was something like this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">James White, a groceryman, was
found dying yesterday with a bullet
wound in his abdomen, in the cellar of
his grocery store at 1236 Park street.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The next story on the murder would be concerned
with the unraveling of the mystery, thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The preliminary inquiry yesterday by
Coroner John F. Donalds, into the mysterious
death of James White, the Park
street grocer, resulted in the conclusion
that White was murdered.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">And so the stories might run on day after day following
the solution of the case like the succeeding
chapters of a continued novel, and each one gives
the synopsis of the preceding chapters in its lead, as
every good follow-up story should do.</p>

<p>Suicide stories seldom offer material for follow-up
stories unless there is some mystery surrounding
the case. Sometimes the present condition of a resuscitated
victim of attempted suicide or the disposition
of the estate of a suicide offers material for
rewriting.</p>

<p>Serious storms and floods are usually followed up
for several days. Readers are always interested in
the present condition of the devastated region.
Very often the list of dead and injured is revised
from day to day, and any attempt to lend aid to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
unfortunate victims is always a reason for a later
story.</p>

<p>Any meetings, conferences, trials, conventions, or
the like must be followed up day by day with succeeding
stories. Each story is complete in itself,
but each one adds one more chapter to the report of
the meeting. This method of following a continued
proceeding calls for a series of follow-up stories;
examples of the stories that follow a continued legal
trial will be given later under Court Reporting.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>Many other illustrations might be given of follow-up
stories that appear daily in the newspapers.
In the last analysis, the follow-up or the rewrite
story is nothing more than an ordinary news story,
and as such must be written in the same way. It
begins with a lead which plays up a feature and
answers the reader's questions about the subject;
the body of the story runs along like the body
of any news story. But it is different in being
a later chapter of a previous account; while complete
in itself, it must not only indicate the previous
story, but must tell its most important facts for
readers who may have missed the previous story.
It is simply a news story which is tied to a previous
story by a string of cause and effect.</p>

<p><b>4. Following Up Related Subjects.</b>&mdash;In this connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
it may be well to mention another kind of
follow-up story that is usually written in connection
with big news events. It is written to develop and
follow up side lines of interest growing out of the
main story. In its most usual form it is a statistical
summary of events similar to the great event of
the day&mdash;such as similar fires, similar railroad
wrecks, etc., in the past. Any big story attracts so
much attention among newspaper readers that the
facts at hand are usually not sufficient to supply the
public's demand for information on the subject. To
satisfy these demands editors develop lines of interest
growing out of the main event. They interview
people concerning the event and concerning
similar events; they describe similar events that
have taken place in the past; they summarize and
compare similar events in the past&mdash;in short, they
follow up every line of interest opened up by the big
story and write stories on the result. These stories
are of the nature of follow-up stories in that they
grow out of, and develop, the main story in its
greatest extent.</p>

<p>For example, the wreck of the ocean liner <em>Titanic</em>
called for innumerable side stories because the public's
interest demanded more facts than the newspapers
had at hand to supply. Hence, the papers
wrote up similar shipwrecks in the past, gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
together summaries of the world's greatest shipwrecks,
interviewed people who had been in any
way connected with shipwrecks or with any phase
of this shipwreck, described glaciers and icebergs,
estimated the depth of the ocean where the <em>Titanic</em>
sank, described the White Star liner and other liners,
pictured real or imaginary shipwrecks, and developed
every other related subject. The real news
in all this mass of material was very meager, but the
related stories satisfied the greedy public and helped
newspaper readers to understand and to picture the
real significance of the meager news.</p>

<p>In the same way a disastrous fire, like the burning
of the Iroquois Theater, calls for innumerable
outgrowing stories. Even when the event reported
in the main news story is not sufficiently important
to call for related stories, it is often accompanied
by a list (usually put in a box at the head of the
story) of other similar events and their results.
These follow-up stories of related subjects are, in
form, very much like feature stories, although they
usually conform to the follow-up idea of mentioning
in their leads the main news event to which they are
related.</p>

<br />
<small>REPORTS OF SPEECHES</small></h2>


<p>Every profession has its disagreeable tasks; journalism
has perhaps more disagreeable tasks than
any other profession. All of a reporter's work is
not concerned with running down thrilling stories
and writing them up in a whirl of breathless interest.
Our readers demand other kinds of news, and
it is the reporter's task to satisfy them faithfully.
There is probably no phase of the work that is quite
so irksome as the reporting of speeches, lectures,
sermons, etc., and there is probably no phase of the
work about which most reporters have fewer definite
rules or ideas. Read the reports of the same
speech in two different papers and note the difference.
They seldom contain the same things and
more seldom do they tell what the speaker said, in
the way and the spirit in which he said it. It is irksome
work and difficult work to condense an hour's
talk into three stickfuls, and few reporters know exactly
how to go about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
The report of a speech or a sermon or a lecture
may come to a newspaper office in one of two ways.
A copy of it may be sent to the paper or the reporter
may have to go to hear the address and take notes
on it. Very often the speaker kindly sends a
printed or typewritten copy of his speech to the editor
a few days in advance with the permission to
release it&mdash;or print it&mdash;on a certain date, after the
speech has been delivered in public. If the speech
is to be printed in full, the task is a mere matter of
editing and does not trouble the reporter. Very
few speeches receive so much space. The others
must be condensed and put in shape for printing.</p>

<p>After all, the usual way to get a speech is to go
to the public delivery of the speech and bring back a
report of it. At first sight this is a difficult task and
green reporters come back with a very poor resum&eacute;.
However, a word or two of advice from the editor
or some bitter experience eases the way. Some advice
may be given here to prepare the would-be reporter
beforehand.</p>

<p>Some reporters who know shorthand prefer to
make a stenographic report of the entire speech and
rearrange and condense it in the office. This method
is advisable only in the case of speeches of the greatest
importance; it is too laborious for ordinary purposes,
since the account includes at most only a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the speech. The best way, doubtless, to get a
speech is to take notes on it. And yet this must be
done properly or there is a danger of misinterpretation
of statements or of undue emphasis upon any
single part of the speech. The report of a speech
should be as well balanced and logical as the speech
itself, differing from the original only in length and
the omission of details. The speech report must be
accurate and truthful or the speaker may appear at
the office in a day or two with blood in his eye. A
few rules may be suggested as an aid to accuracy
and truthfulness.</p>

<p>In the first place, do not try to get all the speech;
do not try to get more than a small part of it&mdash;the
important part. There are two ways of doing this.
If the speech is well arranged and orderly it is easy
to tell when the speaker has finished one sub-division
and is beginning another. Each division and
subdivision will naturally contain a topic sentence.
Watch for the topic sentences and get them down
with the briefest necessary explanation to make
them clear. Political speeches or impromptu talks
are, on the other hand, not always so logically arranged.
Sometimes it is possible to get the topic
sentences, but more often it is not. Then watch for
the interesting or striking statements. You will be
aided in this by the audience about you. Whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the speaker says anything unusually striking or of
more than ordinary interest the audience will show
it by signs of assent or dissent. Watch for these
signs, even for applause&mdash;and take down the statement
that was the cause. If the statement interested
the original audience it will interest your readers.
Naturally, mere oratorical trivialities must not
be mistaken for striking statements.</p>

<p>When you get back to the office to write up the
report of the speech you will feel the need of direct
quotations&mdash;in fact, the length of your report will
be determined by the number of direct quotations
that you have to use in it&mdash;as well as by editorial
dictum. It would be entirely wrong to quote any
expressions of your own because they are somewhat
like the speaker's statements, and it is impossible to
quote anything less than a complete sentence in the
report of a speech. Hence you will need complete
sentences taken down verbatim in the exact words
of the speaker. Make it a point to get complete
sentences as you listen to the speech. Whenever a
striking statement or an interesting part of the
speech seems worth putting in your story get it
down completely. You will find yourself writing
most of the time because, while you are writing
down one important sentence, the speaker will be
uttering several more in explanation and may say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
something else of interest before you have finished
writing down his first statement. Strict attention,
a quick pencil, and a good memory are needed for
this kind of work, but the reporting of speeches will
lose its terrors after you have had a very small
amount of practice.</p>

<p>Just as any news story begins with a lead and
plays up its most striking fact in the first line, the
report of a speech usually begins with the speaker's
most striking or most important statement. As
you are listening to his words watch for something
striking for the lead&mdash;something that will catch the
reader's eye and interest him. But you must exercise
great care in selecting the statement for the
lead. Theoretically and practically it must be something
in strict accordance with the entire content of
the speech and, if possible, it should be the one statement
that sums up the whole speech in the most
concise way. Somewhere in the discourse, at the
beginning, at the end, or in some emphatic place, the
speaker will usually sum up his complete ideas on the
subject in a striking, concise way. Watch for this
summary and get it down for the lead. However,
there may be times when this summary, though
concise, will be of little interest to the average reader
and you will be forced to use some other striking
statement. Then it is perfectly permissible to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
any striking statement in the speech and use it for
the lead, provided that the statement is directly connected
with the rest of the discourse. But be fair
to the speaker. Do not play up some chance remark
as illustrative of the entire utterance; don't bring in
an aside as the most interesting thing in his speech.
If a preacher forgets himself to the extent of expressing
a chance political opinion, it would obviously
be unfair to him for you to play up that remark
as the summary of his sermon. Your readers
would get a false impression and the preacher would
be angry. If he considers the chance remark of
real importance in his sermon he will back it up with
other statements that will give you an excuse for
using it. In brief, watch for the most interesting
and most striking statement in the entire speech, and
in selecting this statement be fair and just and try to
avoid giving a false impression of the speaker or
of the speech. If you follow this rule you will
never be in any danger of getting your paper into
difficulties.</p>

<p>Another rule in reporting lectures, speeches, etc.,
applies to the writing of all newspaper stories.
Write your report at once while the speech is still
fresh in your mind. Your report must preserve
the logic and continuity of the speech&mdash;it must be a
fair resum&eacute;. Your notes will be at best mere jottings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of chance sentences here and there. Do not
allow them to get cold and lose their continuity.
Write the report at once.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>The writing of the report of a speech, lecture, or
sermon is the same whether it is taken from a
printed or stenographic copy of the discourse or
from notes. It is perhaps easier to write from your
notes because you have the important parts of the
speech picked out, ready for use, by the aid of the
rest of the audience. Before you can resum&eacute; a
printed copy of the speech you must go through it
and pick out the important sentences which you
wish to quote and decide upon the most striking
statement for the lead. There is no definite rule
that can be followed in this except to take the topic
sentences whenever they are stated with sufficient
clearness. When you have decided on the statements
that you wish to quote you have really reduced
the speech to a form practically identical with
the notes taken from verbal utterance, and the writing
in either case is the same.</p>

<p>The lead of the report is very much like the lead
of any other news story&mdash;for the report of a speech
is really a news story. As soon as the speech is
mentioned, the reader unconsciously asks a number
of questions about it and the reporter must answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
them in the first sentence. As in any other news
story the questions are: <em>What?</em> <em>Who?</em> <em>Where?</em>
<em>When?</em> and perhaps <em>How?</em> and <em>Why?</em> Reduced to
the case of the speech report, they amount to what
did he say, who said it, where did he say it, when,
and perhaps how and why did he say it. You may
answer the <em>what</em> by giving the subject of the discourse
or by giving a striking statement in it. In
every report the answer to some one of the questions
is of greater interest and must be placed in the
first line. If the speaker is of more than ordinary
prominence his name makes a good beginning. If
an ordinary person makes a speech at some meeting
of prominence the <em>when</em> or <em>where</em> takes precedence
over his name. But in most cases the reporter will
find that none of these things is of sufficient importance
for the beginning. Most public utterances
that he will be called upon to report will be made by
ordinary men in ordinary places and at ordinary
times, and the most interesting part of the story will
be what was said. Sometimes it suffices to give the
title of the speech, but more often a striking statement
from the speech makes the best beginning.
However, although the speaker, the time, the place,
etc., are overshadowed in importance by the subject
or content of what the speaker says, they must be
included in the same sentence with the title or striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
statement. That is, in short, we catch the reader's
interest with a striking statement from the
speech and then delay the rest of the report while
we tell who said it, when, where, etc. The necessity
of this is obvious.</p>

<p>In accordance with the foregoing there are several
possible ways in which to begin the lead of the
report of any speech. It would be wrong to say
that any one is more common or better than the
others; the choice of the beginning must rest
with the reporter. And yet there are various things
to be noted in connection with each of these beginnings.</p>

<p><b>1. Direct Quotation Beginning.&mdash;Sentence.</b>&mdash;The
quotation that is to have the first line must of course
be the most striking or the most interesting statement
in the speech. If it consists of a single sentence&mdash;and
it cannot be less than a sentence&mdash;the report
may begin thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"Participation in government is not
only the privilege, but the right, of
every American citizen and should be
considered a duty," said the Rev. Frederick
W. Hamilton, president of Tufts
College, who spoke on "The Political
Duties of the American Citizen" at the
monthly men's neighborhood meeting in
the Roxbury Neighborhood House last
night.&mdash;<em>Boston Herald.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Here the reporter has given us a sentence that is
practically a summary of the speech, has told us who
said it, when and where, and has completed the paragraph
with the title of the speech. Sometimes the
title of the speech is not of great importance and
its place in the lead may be given to a little summary
as in the following:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"The modern man isn't afraid of
hell," was the concise explanation which
W. Lathrop Meaker gave in Franklin
Union Hall yesterday afternoon and
evening of the fact that the churches are
losing their grip on the average man.&mdash;<em>New
York Sun.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">A question which embodies the content of a speech
may often be quoted at the beginning; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"Will the Baptist church continue to
maintain an attitude of timidity when
John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil
is mentioned?" asked the Rev. R. A.
Bateman, from East Jaffrey, N. H., of
the ministers assembled in Ford Hall
last evening at the New England Baptist
conference.&mdash;<em>Boston Herald.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The opening quotation may sometimes be made an
excuse for a brief description of the speaker or his
gestures as in the following. This is good at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
but it may easily be overworked or become "yellow"
in tone.</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"There is no fire escape," remarked
Gypsy Smith, the famous English evangelist,
yesterday before the fashionable
audience of the Fifth Avenue Baptist
Church. He held aloft a Bible as he
made this declaration during an eloquent
sermon on the possibility of losing
faith and wandering from the narrow
way.&mdash;<em>New York World.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>2. Direct Quotation Beginning.&mdash;Paragraph.</b>&mdash;You
notice that in each of the foregoing the quoted sentence
is incorporated grammatically into the first
sentence of the lead. It is followed by a comma and
the words "said Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," "was the statement
of &mdash;&mdash;," "declared Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," etc. This construction
is possible only when the quoted sentence is
short and simple. When it is long or complex, it
is well to paragraph it separately and to put the
explanations in a separate paragraph, thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"If the United States had possessed
in 1898 a single dirigible balloon, even
of the size of the one now at Fort
Myer, Virginia, which cost less than
$10,000, the American army and navy
would not have long remained in doubt
of the presence of Cervera's fleet in
Santiago harbor."</p>

<p class="nt"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
This statement was made today by
Major G. O. Squier, assistant chief signal
officer of the army, in an address
on a&euml;ronautics delivered before the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers
at 29 West Thirty-ninth street.&mdash;<em>New
York Mail.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">This same construction must <em>always</em> be used when
the statement quoted in the lead consists of more
than one sentence, as in the following:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"The climate of Wisconsin is as good
for recovery from tuberculosis as that
of any state in the union. It is not the
climate, but the out-of-doors air that
works the cure."</p>

<p class="nt nb">So said Harvey Dee Brown in his
tuberculosis crusade lecture in Kilbourn
park last night.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">It is to be noted that the statement quoted in the
lead is never split into two parts, separated by explanation.
The quotation is always gathered together
at the beginning and followed by the explanation.</p>

<p><b>3. Indirect Quotation Beginning.</b>&mdash;This method is
best adapted to the playing up of a brief resum&eacute; of
the content of the speech. It is sometimes called
the "<em>that</em>-clause beginning" because it always begins
with a <em>that</em>-clause which is the subject of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
verb of the sentence&mdash;"was the statement of,"
"was the declaration of," etc. The <em>that</em>-clause may
contain a resum&eacute; of the entire speech or only the
most striking statement in it. Here is one of the
latter:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">That the cruise of the battleship fleet
around the world has taught the citizens
of the United States that a powerful
fleet is needed in the Pacific was the
statement of Rear Admiral R. C. Hollyday,
chief of the bureau of yards and
docks of the navy, at a luncheon given
to him by the board of trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce at the Fairmont
Hotel yesterday.&mdash;<em>San Francisco Examiner.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">It is not always necessary to use the phrase "was
the statement of." A variation from it is often
very good:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">That it is the urgent mission of the
white people of America, through their
churches and Sunday-schools, to educate
the American negro morally and religiously,
was the sentiment of the
twelfth session of the International Sunday-school
Convention last night, voiced
with special power and eloquence by Dr.
Booker T. Washington, the chief
speaker of the evening.&mdash;<em>Louisville
Courier-Journal.</em></p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">That the Irish race has a great destiny
to fulfill, one greater than it has
achieved in its glorious past, was the
prophecy of Prof. Charles Johnston of
Dublin university in his lecture at the
city library Sunday afternoon.&mdash;<em>Wisconsin
State Journal.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">It is perfectly good usage to begin such a lead
with two <em>that</em>-clauses or even with three. The two
clauses in this case are of course treated as a singular
subject and take a singular verb. It is usually
best not to have more than three clauses at the beginning
and even three must be handled with great
care. Three clauses at the beginning, if at all long,
bury the speaker's name too deeply and may become
too complicated. Unless the clauses are very closely
related in idea, it is usually better not to use more
than two. Naturally when more than one <em>that</em>-clause
is used in the lead, all of the clauses must be
gathered together at the beginning; never should
one precede and one follow the principal verb. Here
is an example of good usage:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">NEW YORK, Feb. 25.&mdash;That America
is entering upon a new era of civic
and business rectitude and that this is
due to the awakening of the moral
conscience of the whole people was the
prophecy made here tonight by Governor
Joseph W. Folk of Missouri.&mdash;<em>Chicago
Record-Herald.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
<b>4. Summary Beginning.</b>&mdash;This is a less formal way
of treating the indirect quotation beginning. It
is simply a different grammatical construction.
Whereas in the <em>that</em>-clause beginning the principal
verb of the sentence is outside the summary (e. g.,
"That ... was the statement of"), in the
summary beginning the principal verb of the sentence
is the verb of the summary and the speaker is
brought in by means of a modifying phrase; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 1.&mdash;Both the
free trader and the stand-patter are
back numbers, according to Senator Albert
J. Beveridge of Indiana, who delivered
a tariff speech here tonight.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Federal control of the capitalization of
railroads is the solution of the railroad
problem suggested by E. L. Phillipp, the
well-known Milwaukee railroad expert,
in the course of a speech at the third
annual banquet of, etc.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free
Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The summary beginning may be handled in many
different ways and allows perhaps more grammatical
liberty than any other beginning. The summary
may even be given a sentence by itself as in the
following. This kind of treatment may easily be
overdone and should be handled with great caution:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
If you have acute mania, it is the
proper thing to take the music cure.
Miss Jessie A. Fowler says so, and she
knows. Miss Fowler discussed "Music
Hygienically" before the "Rainy
Daisies" at the Hotel Astor yesterday
and prescribed musical treatment for
various brands of mania.&mdash;<em>New York
World.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>5. Keynote Beginning.</b>&mdash;Very closely related to
the summary beginning is the keynote beginning, in
which the subject of the main verb is an indirect
presentation of the content of the speech. Whereas
the summary beginning displays its resum&eacute; in a
complete sentence, the keynote beginning puts the
content of the speech in a single noun and its modifiers.
Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The ideal state university was the
theme of a speech delivered by, etc.</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The mission of the newspaper to tell
the truth, to stand for high ideals, and
to strive to have those ideals adopted
by the public was the keynote of an address
delivered by, etc.</p>
</div>

<p><b>6. Participial Beginning.</b>&mdash;This is less common
than the other kinds of indirect quotation beginnings
but it is often very effective. The summary of the
speech or the most striking statement is put into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
participial phrase at the beginning and is made to
modify the subject of the sentence (the speaker).
It must of course be remembered that such a participial
phrase can be used only to modify a noun,
as an adjective modifies a noun, and can never be
made the subject of a verb. Here is an example of
good use of this beginning:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Upholding the right of public criticism
of the courts on the theory that
there can be no impropriety in investigating
any act of a public official, Judge
Kennesaw M. Landis last night addressed
the students of Marquette College
of Law and many members of the
Milwaukee bar.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Just as it is perfectly possible to begin an indirect
quotation lead with two <em>that</em>-clauses instead of one,
it is also possible to use two participial phrases in
the participial beginning; as:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Pleading for justice and human affection
in dealing with the delinquent
child, and urging the vital need of legislation
which shall enforce parental
responsibility, Mrs. Nellie Duncan made
an address yesterday which stirred the
sympathies of an attentive audience in
the First Presbyterian Church.&mdash;<em>San
Francisco Examiner.</em></p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p class="noi">Although the participial phrase usually gives the
summary of the speech, not infrequently the participial
construction is used to play up the name of
the speech or some other fact and the summary comes
after the principal verb of the lead; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Paying tribute to the memory of
President William McKinley last night
at the Metropolitan Temple, where exercises
were held to dedicate the McKinley
memorial organ, Judge Taft told
in detail of his commission to the Philippine
service and his subsequent intimate
connection with the President.&mdash;<em>New
York Tribune.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>7. Title Beginning.</b>&mdash;There are two reasons for beginning
the report of a public utterance with the
speaker's subject or title. The title itself may be
so broad that it makes a good summary of the
speech, or it may be so striking in itself that it attracts
interest at once. In the following examples
the title is really a summary of the speech:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">NEW YORK, Dec. 15.&mdash;"The Compensation
of Employes for Injuries Received
While at Work" was taken by
J. D. Beck, commissioner of labor of
Wisconsin, as the theme of his address
before the National Civic Federation
here today.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
"The Emmanuel Movement" was the
subject of an address by Rabbi Stephen
S. Wise of the Free Synagogue yesterday
morning.&mdash;<em>New York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">In the following stories the reporter began with
the title evidently because it was so strikingly unusual
and also because it was the title of a strikingly
unusual speech by an unusual man. This kind of
title beginning is always very effective:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"Booze, or Get on the Water Wagon,"
was the subject on which Rev. Billy
Sunday, the baseball evangelist, addressed
an audience of over 4,000 persons
at the Midland Chautauqua yesterday
afternoon. For two hours Sunday
fired volley after volley at the
liquor traffic.&mdash;<em>Des Moines Capital.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"If Christ Came to Milwaukee" was
the subject of the Rev. Paul B. Jenkin's
Sunday night in Immanuel Presbyterian
Church.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>8. Speaker Beginning.</b>&mdash;It is obvious that this is
the easiest beginning that may be used in the report
of a speech. But just as obviously it is the beginning
that should be least used. Just as in writing
news stories a green reporter always attempts to
begin every lead with the name of some person involved,
in reporting a public discourse he has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
strong desire to put the name of the speaker before
what the speaker said. But the same tests may be
applied to both cases. Are our readers more interested
in what a man does than in the man himself;
do our readers go to hear a given speaker because
they wish to hear what he has to say or because
they wish to hear <em>him</em>? Whenever the public is so
interested in a man that it does not care what he
says, then you may feel safe in beginning the report
of what he says with his name. This test may be
altered, especially in smaller cities, by previous interest
in the speech; if the speech has been expected
and looked forward to with interest, then, no matter
if the speaker is the President himself, his name
is not as good news as what he has to say. Even
if the lead does begin with the speaker's name, the
reporter usually tries to bring a summary of the
speech or the most striking statement into the first
sentence after the name. For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Speaker Joseph G. Cannon placed
himself on record last night in favor
of a revision of the tariff in accordance
with the promise of the Republican
party platform and declared that so far
as his vote was concerned he would see
to it that the announced policy of revision
would be written in the national
laws as soon as possible. The words
of the speaker came at a luncheon given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to six rear admirals of the United States
navy by Alexander H. Revell of Chicago
in the Union League Club, at which the
need of more battleships and increased
efficiency of the fighting forces of the
republic were the principal themes of
discussion.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">This example was chosen because, while it is written
in accordance with the rules of the speaker beginning,
it is obviously too long and complicated&mdash;over
110 words. It would be better to gather it
together and condense it as in the following:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot opened
the second day's session of the national
conservation congress yesterday by an
address in which he expressed his entire
satisfaction and his confidence in
the attitude of President Taft toward
conservating the national resources.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 10.&mdash;Booker
T. Washington of Tuskegee, Ala., in an
address at the People's Church tonight
predicted that within two years the
liquor traffic would be driven out of all
the southern states but two.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<p>There are obviously other beginnings that cannot
be classed under any of the above heads. Some
of them, much like the "freak" leads that may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
seen in many newspapers of the present day, may be
called free beginnings for want of a better name.
These free beginnings are quite effective when properly
handled but the novice must use them with fear
and trembling. They may be witty or they may be
sarcastic, but they are usually dangerous. The difference
in the eight beginnings discussed above is
mainly one of grammatical construction; the same
fundamental ideas govern them all. Their purpose
is always to play up a striking statement or a
summary of the speech report and to give at the
very outset the necessary explanation concerning
the speech.</p>


<p class="c2">THE BODY OF THE REPORT</p>

<p>The body of the report of a speech is not so distinct
from the lead as the body of an ordinary
news story. In the news story it is safe to assume
that many readers will not go beyond the lead, but
in the report of a speech this is not so true. It is
less possible to give the main facts in the lead of
a speech report and the rest of the story is more
necessary. Hence it must be written with as great
care as the lead.</p>

<p>The body of the report should consist of direct
quotation in so far as possible. The reader is interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in what the speaker said and it is impossible
to make a summary in indirect discourse as
convincing as the actual quotation of his words. Be
sure that the quotations are the speaker's exact
words or very nearly his exact words, so that he
cannot accuse you of misquoting him. The spirit
of his words must be in the quotation, anyway.</p>

<p>In these quotations nothing less than a complete
sentence should be quoted. Do not patch together
sentences of indirect and direct quotation, like the
following&mdash;He said that some of us are prone to
let things be as they are, "because the philanthropic
rich help in our times of trouble and in sickness."
Such quotation is worse than no direct quotation
at all. Of course, this does not mean that one cannot
add "said the speaker" to a direct quotation, but
it means that "said the speaker" can be added only
to quotations that are complete sentences. Furthermore
whenever it is necessary to bring in "said the
speaker," or similar expressions, they should be
added at the end of the quoted sentence&mdash;the least
emphatic part of a newspaper sentence.</p>

<p>Obviously a condensed report of a speech can only
quote sentences here and there throughout the
speech&mdash;the high spots of interest, as we called
them before. These must not be quoted promiscuously
and disconnectedly. The original speech had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a logical order and set forth a logical train of
thought. These should be followed as far as possible
in the report. Bring in the quotations in their
true order and fill the gaps between them with indirect
discourse to knit them together and to give
the report the coherence of the original speech. But
do not carry this indirect explanation to the extent
of making your copy a report of the speech in indirect
discourse with occasional bits of direct quotation
to illustrate. Remember that, after all, the
direct quotation is the truly effective part of the
speech.</p>

<p>Whenever a paragraph contains both direct and
indirect quotation, the direct quotation should always
precede the indirect. But it is much better
to paragraph the two kinds of quotation separately,
making each paragraph entirely of direct, or entirely
of indirect, quotation. If a paragraph must contain
both, begin it with the direct so that as the reader
glances down the column he will see a quotation
mark at the beginnings of most, if not all, of the
paragraphs. By the same sign, when your notes
are lacking in direct quotations, bring in as many
of the quotations as possible at the beginning of the
report and let the indirect summary occupy the end
where it may be cut off by the editor if he does not
wish to run it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Here is a good illustration of a part of the body
of a good speech report&mdash;it is the second paragraph
of one of the stories quoted under the "Speaker"
beginning above:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"I can not account for the moral revolution
that is sweeping over the South,"
he continued. "The sentiment against
whisky is deeper than the mere desire to
get it away from the black man. That
same sentiment is found in counties that
contain no negro population. People
who say that the law will not be enforced
have not been in the South.&mdash;B.
T. Washington's speech, <em>Milwaukee
Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">You will notice that although the above paragraph
is composed entirely of direct quotation it has no
quotation mark at the end. This is, of course, in
accordance with the old rule of rhetoric which says
that in a continuous quotation each paragraph shall
begin with a quotation mark but only the last shall
be closed by a quotation mark.</p>

<p>To illustrate the errors that may be made in reporting
speeches we might write the above paragraph
as follows:</p>


<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Mr. Washington continued by saying
that he could not account for the revolution
that is sweeping over the South.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
"The sentiment against whisky is deeper
than the mere desire to get it away from
the black man." He says that "the same
sentiment is found in counties that contain
no negro population." People who
say that the law will not be enforced
"have not been in the South," according
to Booker T. Washington.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The clumsiness of this mingling of direct and indirect
quotation is very clear, as is the weakness of beginning
with an explanation that is really subordinate.</p>

<p>Much more could be said about the reporting of
speeches. Very few things will make a man so
angry as the misquoting of his words. Therefore,
whatever other faults your report of a speech may
have, let it be accurate and truthful.</p>

<a name="xi" id="xi"></a>XI<br />
<br />
<small>INTERVIEWS</small></h2>


<p>If you compare any interview story with any
speech report in any representative newspaper, you
will readily see how a discussion of interviews easily
becomes an explanation of the differences between
interview stories and speech-reports; that
is, how the report of an interview differs from the
report of a public utterance of a more formal kind.
There are few differences in the written reports.
Each usually begins with a summary or a striking
statement and consists largely of direct quotation.
Were it not for the line or two of explanation at
the end of the introduction, it would be practically
impossible to tell the one from the other, to tell
which of the reports sets forth statements made in
a public discourse and which gives statements made
in a more private way to a reporter.</p>

<p>The difference lies behind the report, in the way
the reporter obtained the statements and quotations.
And the whole difference depends upon the attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of the man who made the statements&mdash;whether his
words were a conscious or an unconscious public
utterance. When a man speaks from a platform he
utters every sentence and every word with an idea
of possible quotation&mdash;he is not only willing to be
quoted but he wants to be quoted. But when he
speaks privately to a reporter he usually dreads quotation.
Of course, he expects that you will print a
few of his remarks but he is constantly hoping that
you will not remember and print them all. He
speaks more guardedly, too, since he is not sure of
the interpretation that may be given to his words.
Hence it is a very different matter to report what
a man says in public and to get statements for the
press from him in private. Any one can report
a speech but great skill is required to get a good interview&mdash;especially
if the victim is unwilling to talk.</p>

<p>The first matter that a reporter has to consider
is the means of retaining the statements until he
is able to write his story. It is a simple matter to
get quotations from a speech because it is possible
to sit anywhere in the audience and write down
the speaker's words in a notebook as they are uttered.
But the notebook must be left behind when
you try to interview. When a man is not used to
being interviewed nothing will make him reticent
so quickly as the appearance of a notebook and pencil;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
he realizes that his words are to appear in print
just as he utters them and he immediately becomes
frightened. Ordinarily so long as he feels that
what he says is going into the confidential ear of
the reporter&mdash;and out of the other ear just
as quickly&mdash;he is willing to talk more freely and
openly and to say exactly what he thinks. This,
of course, does not apply to prominent men who
are used to being interviewed and prefer to have
their remarks taken down verbatim. Such an interview,
however, is little more than a call to secure
a statement for publication.</p>

<p>It might be well to settle the notebook question
here and now when it assumes the greatest importance.
The stage has hardened us to seeing a reporter
slinking around the outskirts of every bit of
excitement writing excitedly and hurriedly in a
large leather notebook. So hardened are we to the
sight that some new reporters buy a notebook just
as soon as they get a place on a newspaper staff.
But real reporters on real newspapers do not use
notebooks. A few sheets of folded copy paper hidden
carefully in an inside pocket ready for names
and addresses and perhaps figures are all that most
of them carry. Many people dread publicity and
the appearance of a notebook frightens them into
silence more quickly than the actual appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a representative of the press. This is true in the
reporting of any bit of news, in the covering of any
story&mdash;and it is ordinarily true in interviewing for
statements that are to be quoted. Of course, an
exception to this must be made in the case of some
prominent men who prefer to issue signed written
statements when they are interviewed.</p>

<p>The impossibility of using a notebook or writing
down a man's words in an interview seriously complicates
the task of interviewing. Some reporters
train themselves until they are able to remember
their victim's words long enough to get outside and
write them down. Others are satisfied with getting
the ideas and the spirit of what is said together with
the man's manner of talking. A few characteristic
mannerisms thrown in with a true report of his
ideas will make any speaker believe that you have
quoted him exactly. Whichever method is pursued,
the reporter must always be fair and try to tell the
readers of the paper the man's true ideas. The exigencies
of the case give the reporter greater liberty
than in quoting from a speech but he must not abuse
his liberty.</p>

<p>The success of an interview depends very largely
upon the way in which a reporter approaches the
man whom he wishes to interview. It is never well
to trust to the inspiration of the moment to start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the conversation. The reporter must know exactly
what he wishes to have the man say before he approaches
him and must already have framed his
questions so as to draw out the answers that he
wishes. People are never interviewed except for a
purpose and that purpose should suggest the reporter's
first question. No matter how willing the
man is to tell what he thinks he will seldom begin
talking until the reporter asks him a definite question
to help him in putting his thoughts into words.
All of this should be considered beforehand. The
reporter should have outlined a definite campaign
and have a series of questions which he wishes to
ask. If he has written the questions out beforehand,
the task becomes an easier one&mdash;he merely
fills in the answers on his list later and has the interview
in better form than if he had tried to trust
entirely to his memory. To be sure, the questions
may open up unexpected lines of thought and he
may get more than he went for, but he must have
his questions ready for use as soon as each new line
is exhausted. A skilled reporter frames the interview
himself and keeps the result entirely in his own
hands through the campaign that he has outlined
beforehand. Unless he knows exactly what he
wants to get, a wary victim may lead him off upon
unimportant facts and in the end tell him nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that his paper has sent him to get. A reporter must
keep the reins of an interview in his own possession.</p>

<p>A good reporter takes great care in his manner
of addressing a man whom he is to interview. A
well-known newspaper follows the rule of asking
its reporters never to do what a gentleman would not
do. A reporter who is trying to interview must always
be a gentleman and must not ask questions
that a gentleman would not ask. If the victim is
a prominent man of great personality it is not hard
to follow this rule&mdash;in fact, it is impossible to get
the interview by any other method of approach. But
when one is trying to interview a person of humbler
station, the case is different. It is very easy then
to fall into a habit of demanding information and
turning the interview into an inquisition. But the
reporter who keeps his attitude as a gentleman gets
more real facts even when his victim is of the most
humble social status. Therefore, never approach
your victim as if he were a witness and you a cross-questioning
lawyer. Do not say: "See here, you
know more about it than that," and thus try to
force unwilling information from him. Go at him
in a more round-about way and lead him to give
you the facts unwittingly perhaps.</p>

<p>A young reporter often feels an impulse to become
too personal with the man whom he is interviewing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
He must always remember that he is not there for
a friendly chat but as a representative of a newspaper,
sent to get concise facts or opinions. This
attitude must be maintained even with the humblest
persons. Any desire to sympathize, criticize, or advise
must be checked at the very start. The point
of view must always be kept.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>Although the main difference between writing interview
stories and reporting speeches lies in the
very act of getting the quotations and words of the
speaker, there are certain aspects in which the writing
of an interview story is different. The actual
form of the two stories is almost identical and yet
there is a tone in the interview story that is lacking
in the report of a speech. This may be called the
personal tone.</p>

<p>The very name of the speaker obviously plays a
much larger part in the interview story than in the
speech report. We may be more interested in what
a man says in a public discourse than we are in the
man, but when we interview a man we want his
opinions not for themselves so much as because they
are his opinions. An interview with the President
on the tariff is not necessarily interesting in the
new ideas that it brings out, for we have many
other ways of knowing the President's opinions on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the tariff question; but the interview is worth printing
because every one is interested in reading anything
that the President says, although he may have
read the same thing many times before. A man
is seldom interviewed unless he is of some prominence&mdash;that
is why he is interviewed, and so in
the resulting story his name plays a very important
part. In fact, his name is usually the feature of
the story; most interview stories begin directly
with the name of the man whose statements are
quoted.</p>

<p>Although a man may be interviewed simply
because of his prominence and popularity, there is
usually another reason for the interview. We are
interested not only in hearing him say something
but we wish to hear him say something on a certain
topic. The interview thus has a timeliness, a reason
for existence. Since this timeliness is the reason
for printing a certain man's statements, the reporter's
account must indicate that timeliness near
the beginning. That is, the first sentence of an
interview story must not only tell who was interviewed
and the gist of what he said, but it must
tell why he said it. The interview must be connected
with the rest of the day's news. This comes out
very definitely in the custom which many newspapers
have of printing the opinions of many prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
men in connection with any important event.
Perhaps it is because we wish to know their opinions
on the subject or perhaps it is simply because
we are glad to have a chance to hear them talk&mdash;at
any rate many editors make any great event an excuse
for a series of interviews. This is illustrated
by the opinions of the various labor leaders that
were printed with the story of the recent confession
of the McNamara brothers. In such a case, the reporter
must make the reason for the interview his
starting point in the report and must indicate very
plainly why the man was interviewed.</p>

<p>This idea of timeliness is very often carried to the
extent of making the interview merely a denial or
an assertion from the mouth of a well-known man.
There may be an upheaval in Wall Street. Immediately
the papers print an interview in which some
prominent financier denies or asserts that he is at the
bottom of the upheaval. Naturally the report of the
interview begins with the very words of the denial or
the assertion. Very often a man when interviewed
refuses to say anything on the subject. The fact
that he has nothing to say does not mean that the
interview is not worth reporting. In fact, that refusal
to speak may be the most effective thing that
he could say. The reporter begins by telling that
his man had nothing to say on the subject and ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
by telling what he should have said or what his refusal
to speak probably means,&mdash;if the paper is not
too scrupulous in such matters. At any rate, the
denial or assertion or refusal to speak becomes the
starting point of the report and furnishes the excuse
for the interview story. The expanded remarks
that follow the lead are of course important but they
are not so important as the primary expression of
opinion that the reporter went for.</p>

<p>The personal element in interviewing may be carried
to an extreme extent. The man who is interviewed
may so far overshadow the importance of
what he says that the report of the interview becomes
almost a sketch of the man himself. That
is, the report is filled with human interest. The
quotations are interspersed with action and description.
We are told how the man acted when he said
each individual thing. His appearance, attitude, expression,
and surroundings become as important
as his words and are brought into the report as vividly
as possible. Such an interview may become
almost large enough to be used as a special feature
story for the Sunday edition, but when the human
interest is limited to a comparatively subordinate
position the report still keeps its character as an
interview news story. Such a thing may be illustrated
from the daily press:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
"I would rather have four battleships
and need only two than to have two and
need four."</p>

<p class="nt">Seated in the cool library of Colonel
A. K. McClure's summer home at Wallingford,
Rear Admiral Winfield Scott
Schley, retired, thus expressed himself
yesterday on the need of a larger and
greater navy.</p>
</div>

<p>After all has been said about interviewing, the
one thing that a reporter must remember is that
an interview story is at best rather dry and everything
that he can do to increase the interest will
improve the interview. But all of this must be
done with absolute fairness to the speaker and great
truthfulness in the quotation of his ideas and
opinions.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>To come to the technical form of the interview
story, we find that there are very nearly as many
possible beginnings as in the case of the report of
a speech. The interview story must begin with a
lead that tells who was interviewed, when, and
where, what he said (in a quotation or an indirect
summary), and why he was interviewed. This is
like the lead of a speech report in every particular
except in the timeliness&mdash;the occasion for a speech
is seldom mentioned in the lead, but a reporter usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
tells at once why he interviewed the man whose
words he quotes.</p>

<p><b>1. Speaker Beginning.</b>&mdash;The very purpose behind
interviewing makes the so-called speaker beginning
most common. It is almost an invariable rule that
the report of an interview must begin with the
man's name unless what he says is of greater importance
than his name&mdash;which is seldom.</p>

<p>The simplest form of the speaker beginning is the
one in which the speaker's name is followed directly
by a summary of what he said, as:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of
Leland Stanford Junior University, said
yesterday at the Holland House that in
the development of American universities
educators must separate the lower
two classes from the upper two, the
present freshman and sophomore classes
to be absorbed by small colleges or supplemental
high schools, making the junior
year the first in the university training.
He said the universities should receive
only men, not boys.&mdash;<em>New York
Tribune.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Another kind of speaker beginning may devote
most of the lead to the explanation of the reason
for the interview, giving the briefest possible summary
of what was said: Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Director Lang of the department of
public safety is going to place a ban on
the playing of tennis on Sunday. He
doesn't know just yet how he is going
to accomplish this, but yesterday he declared
that he would find some law applicable
to the case.&mdash;<em>Pittsburgh Gazette-Times.</em></p>
</div>

<p>One step further brings us to the entire exclusion
of the result of the interview from the lead. In this
case the reason for the interview occupies the entire
lead and we must read part of the second paragraph
to find what the man said; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Charles F. Washburn, Richmond
Hill's wizard of finance, promises to
appear at his broker's office in Newark,
N. J., this morning with a fresh bank
roll, accumulated since the close of the
market on Saturday.</p>

<p class="nt">(The second paragraph tells what it
is all about and the third quotes his
words.)&mdash;<em>New York World.</em></p>
</div>

<p>It is to be noted that in each of the above leads
the speaker's name is always accompanied by a
word or two telling who he is and why he was interviewed.
Furthermore the reporter himself has
no more place in the lead than if he were reporting
a speech&mdash;his existence and the part he played in
getting the interview are strictly ignored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2. Summary Beginning.</b>&mdash;There are two common
ways of beginning an interview story with a summary.
First, the lead may begin with a <em>that</em>-clause
which embodies the gist of the interview; this is
like the <em>that</em>-clause beginning of the report of a
speech; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">That the apparent apathy among the
voters of the country is merely contentment
with the present administration of
affairs by the Republican party is the
contention of ex-Senator John M.
Thurston of Nebraska. Mr. Thurston
was at Republican national headquarters
today, etc.&mdash;<em>New York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Secondly the summary beginning is used in the
case of an interview that is a denial or an assertion
by the man interviewed. The lead begins with a
clause or a participial phrase embodying the substance
of the interview, and the name of the speaker
is made the subject of a verb of denying or asserting;
thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Declaring that his office is run as economically
as possible, Sheriff H. E.
Franke denied on Sunday that he had
expended more than $688 for auto hire
to collect $1,409.28 of alleged taxes.</p>

<p class="nt nb">(The second paragraph begins with a
direct quotation.)&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Sentinel.</em></p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Although he had sharply criticised
Roosevelt's special message condemning
some of the uses to which the possessors
of large fortunes are putting their
wealth, President Jacob Gould Schurman,
Cornell University, declined to discuss
Roosevelt or his policies in Milwaukee
yesterday. He said that he was
not talking politics.</p>

<p class="nt nb">(The rest of the report is a quotation
of his views on college athletics.)&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>3. Quotation Beginning.</b>&mdash;Many reports of interviews
begin with a direct quotation. The logic of
this is that the expression of opinion is, in some
cases, of more interest than the name of the man
who expressed the opinion. Sometimes the name
of the speaker is not considered worth mentioning
and in that case a direct quotation is the only advisable
beginning; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"With the prices of food for hogs
and cattle going up, it is natural that
the food&mdash;beef and pork&mdash;for us humans
should keep pace."</p>

<p class="nt nb">This was the logic of an east-side
butcher who discussed the probable rise
in the prices of meat.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free
Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes a short quotation is used at the beginning
of the lead very much as a title is used in a
speech report; thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">NEW YORK, June 1.&mdash;"A business
proposition which should have been put
in effect nearly twenty years ago," was
John Wanamaker's comment today on
the adoption of 2-cent letter postage between
the United States and Great
Britain and Ireland.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free
Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p>If the quotation at the beginning consists of only
one sentence the name of the speaker may be run
into the same paragraph; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"Judge McPherson's recent decision
declaring Missouri's 2-cent fare confiscatory
is an indication that vested interests
are entitled to some protection
and that legislatures must not go too far
in regulating them," said Sir Thomas
Shaughnessy, president of the Canadian
Pacific road, on Sunday.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<p>However if the quotation at the beginning contains
more than one sentence it is best to paragraph
the quotation separately and leave the name of the
speaker until the second paragraph; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"The American Federation of Labor
will enter the national campaign by
seeking to place labor candidates on the
tickets of the old parties. An independent
labor party is eventually contemplated.
But there is not time to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
results in that way in the next national
campaign."</p>

<p class="nt">So said H. C. Raasch, national president
of the tile-layers, upon his return
yesterday, etc.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>4. Human Interest Beginning.</b>&mdash;This is a designation
devised to cover a multitude of beginnings. A
human interest interview may begin with a quotation,
a summary, a name, or an action. The aim is
necessarily toward unconventionality and the form
of the lead is left to the originality of the reporter.
A few examples may illustrate what is meant by the
human interest beginning:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"There goes another string. Drat
those strings!" Only Joseph Caluder
didn't say "Drat."</p>

<p class="nt">"Say, do you know that I have spent
pretty nearly $1,000 for strings for that
violin? Well, it's a fact. Listen." Etc.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Sentinel.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Fire Marshal James Horan never
bought a firecracker, but for many years
he has celebrated Independence day in
the thick of fires. He never owned a
gun or revolver. His last prayer before
trying to snatch a little needed
sleep Friday night will be of the twofold
form, etc.&mdash;<em>Chicago Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p>After what has been said about the body of a
speech report, there is little more to be said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the body of an interview story. The same rules
apply in both cases. The body of the report should
contain as much direct quotation as possible. However
nothing less than a sentence should be quoted&mdash;that
is, every quotation should be a complete sentence,
with indirect explanation. Whenever "Said
the speaker" or "Mr. Brown continued" or any similar
expression is worked into the direct quotation
it should always be placed at the end of the sentence;
never begin a quotation in this way:&mdash;Mr. Jones
continued, "Furthermore I would say, etc." In
the same way, when a paragraph contains both direct
and indirect quotation, the direct quotation
should be placed at the beginning. Whenever it is
possible, construct solid paragraphs of quotation,
and solid paragraphs of summary. The report as a
whole must have coherence and a logical sequence;
for this a limited amount of indirect quotation may
be used to fill in the gaps in the logic of the direct
quotation.</p>

<p>According to the usage of the best newspapers of
to-day the reporter must never be brought into the
report of an interview. His existence must never
be mentioned although every reader knows that some
reporter secured the interview. In the old days
reporters delighted in bringing themselves into their
stories as "representatives of the press" or "a reporter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for the Dispatch," but that practice has gone
the way of the reporter's leather-bound notebook.
The interview may be told satisfactorily without
a mention of the reporter; hence newspaper usage
has put a ban on his appearance in his story.</p>


<p class="c2">GROUP INTERVIEWS</p>

<p>We have said that a man is seldom interviewed
without a reason; there is always a timeliness in interviewing.
Any unusual event of broad importance
becomes an excuse for the editor to print the opinion
of some prominent man on some phase of the
event. Sometimes the event is of such importance
that the editor wishes to print the opinions of several
men on the subject; or more than one prominent
man may be involved in the affair and the public
may wish to hear the opinions of every one involved.
In such a case when several men are interviewed in
regard to the same event it is considered rather useless
and ineffective to print their interviews separately
and the several interview stories are gathered
together into one story and arranged in such
a way that they may be compared. There are several
ways of doing this.</p>

<p>If the case or event is very well known, a lead or
summary of the several interviews is considered unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and the words of the various men are
grouped together under a single headline. This may
be illustrated by the interviews that were printed
after the confessions of the McNamara brothers of
Los Angeles in the recent dynamiting case. The
<em>Wisconsin State Journal</em> may be taken as representative.
This paper printed the statements of
twelve prominent men interested in the case in a
three-column box under a long head; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="c nt nb"><b>Leaders Discuss the Case</b></p>

<p class="nt nb">Samuel Gompers, president American Federation of
Labor&mdash;I am astounded; I am astounded; my credulity
has been imposed upon. It is a bolt out of a clear
sky.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p class="nt nb">John T. Smith, president Missouri Federation of Labor&mdash;I
can not believe it. But if the McNamaras
blew up the Times building they should be fully punished.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p class="nt nb">Gen. Harrison Grey Otis, publisher of the Times&mdash;The
result may be and ought to be, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>If the case had not been of such broad interest a
lead embodying a summary of the interviews might
have preceded the individual statements. It might
have been done in this way:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Great surprise has been expressed by
the prominent labor leaders of the country
at the confession of the McNamara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
brothers in Los Angeles yesterday. That
organized labor had no connection with
the work of these men and that they
should be fully punished is the consensus
of opinion.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Samuel Gompers, president American
Federation of Labor&mdash;I am astounded;
I am astounded; my credulity has been
imposed upon. It is a bolt out of a
clear sky.</p>

<p class="nt nb">John T. Smith, president Missouri
Federation of Labor&mdash;I can not believe
it. Etc.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">In such a story as the above, the statements are usually
printed without quotation marks; each paragraph
begins with a man's name, followed by a dash
and what he said. The grouping together of several
interviews is often done less formally. The
whole thing may be written as a running story, and
sometimes the names of the persons interviewed
are omitted; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Proprietors of the big flower shops,
the places from which blossoms are delivered
in highly polished and ornate
wagons, drawn by horses that might
win blue ribbons, and where, in the
proper season, a single rose costs three
dollars, do not approve of the comments
made by a dealer who recently
failed. Among these sayings was one
to the effect that young millionaires
spend a thousand dollars a week on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
flowers for chorus girls who earn
twelve dollars a week, and who sometimes
take the flowers back to the shop
to exchange them for money to buy
food and clothes.</p>

<p class="nt nb">"That's all nonsense," said one dealer.
(This paragraph is devoted to his opinion
on the matter.)</p>

<p class="nt">"We have enough trouble in this business,"
said another dealer, "without having
this silly talk given to the public."
(This paragraph gives this dealer's
opinion)&mdash;<em>New York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p>(Each paragraph is devoted to a single interview.)</p>

<p>The same paragraph may be done with more local
color as in the following:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Chinatown feels deeply its bereavement
in the deaths of the Empress Dowager
and the Emperor of China. Chinatown
mourns, but it does so in such an
unobtrusive Oriental way that the casual
visitor on sympathy bent may feel that
his words of condolence would be misplaced.</p>

<p class="nt nb">A reporter from this paper was assigned
yesterday to go up to Chinatown
and in as delicate a way as possible to
gather some of the sentiments of appreciation
of the merits of Kuang-hsu and
his lamented aunt, Tzu-hsi. He was
told that he might write a little about
the picturesque though nevertheless sincere
expressions of mourning that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
might observe in Pell and Mott streets.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Mr. Jaw Gum, senior partner in the
firm of Jaw Gum &amp; Co., importers of
cigars, cigarettes, dead duck's eggs and
Chinese delicatessen, of 7 Pell street,
was at home. Mr. Gum was approached.</p>

<p class="nt nb">"We would like to learn a little about
the arrangements that are being made
by the Chinese to indicate their sorrow
at the deaths of their beloved rulers."</p>

<p class="nt nb">"What number?" queried Mr. Gum.
The question was repeated.</p>

<p class="nt nb">"P'licyman, he know," remarked Mr.
Gum sagely.</p>

<p class="nt">(So on for a column with interviews
and statements from several of Mr.
Gum's neighbors.)&mdash;<em>New York Sun.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">But this is very much like a human interest story&mdash;the
reporter takes part in it&mdash;and we shall discuss
that later.</p>

<a name="xii" id="xii"></a>XII<br />
<br />
<small>COURT REPORTING</small></h2>


<p>Probably few classes of news stories present such
a lack of uniformity and such a variety of treatments
as the reports of court news. Legal stories
belong to one of the few sorts of stories that do not
tend to become systematized. But there is a reason
for almost everything in a newspaper and there is
also a reason for the freedom that reporters are
allowed in reporting testimony. The reason in this
case is probably in the fact that very rarely do two
court stories possess the same sort of interest or the
same news value.</p>

<p>We have seen that reports of speeches are printed
in the daily press because our readers are interested
in the content of the speech or in the man who uttered
it. In the same way, our readers are interested
in interviews because of the man who was interviewed,
because of their content, or because of
their bearing on some current event. On the other
hand there is an infinite number of reasons why a
court story is worth printing or why it may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
worth a line. Sometimes the interest is in the persons
involved; sometimes in the significance of the
decision. People may also be interested in a case
because of its political or legal significance or merely
because of the sensational testimony that is given.
And again a very trivial case may be worth a large
amount of space in the daily paper just because of
its human interest&mdash;because of the pathos or humor
that the reporter can bring into it. Thus the resulting
reports are hard to classify. Each one depends
on a different factor for its interest and each
must be written in a different way so that its individual
interest may be most effective. However
there are general tendencies in the reporting of court
news.</p>

<p>The news itself is comparatively easy to get. In
a large city every court is watched every day by a
representative of the press, either a reporter for an
individual paper or for a city news gathering association.
In some cities where there is no independent
news gathering agency papers sometimes club
together to keep one reporter at each court. The
man who is on duty must watch all day long for
cases that are of interest for one reason or another.
Even with all this safeguarding sometimes
an important case slips by the papers; often the reporter
on duty considers of little interest a case that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is worth columns when some paper digs into it.
Every reporter however who is trying to do court
reporting should learn the ordinary routine of legal
proceedings; for example, the place and purpose of
the pleas, the direct and cross examination of witnesses,
and other legal business.</p>

<p>As we shall see when we begin to write court reports,
it is necessary to exercise every possible trick
to put interest into the story. In the actual court
room all that relieves the dreary monotony of legal
proceedings is an occasional bit of interesting testimony.
And when the reporter tries to report a case
he sometimes finds that interesting testimony is all
that will lighten up the dull monotony of his story.
Therefore while he is listening to a case he tries to
get down verbatim a large number of the interesting
questions and answers. Or if he is unable
to be present he tries to get hold of the court stenographer's
record to copy out bits of testimony for
his account. Beyond this recording of testimony
there is really little difficulty in court reporting except
the difficulty of separating the interesting from
the great mass of uninteresting matter.</p>

<p>As to the actual writing of the report of a legal
trial, the one thing that the reporter must remember
is that a case is seldom reported for the public's interest
in the case itself. There is usually some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
reason why the editor wants a half a column of it.
That reason is the thing that the reporter must
watch for and when he finds it he must make it the
feature of his report to be embodied in the first line
of the lead.</p>

<p>When we try to play up the most interesting feature
of a court report we find that we must fall
back upon the same beginnings that we used in reporting
speeches and interviews. There are several
possible ways of beginning such a story, depending
upon the phase of the case or its testimony that is
of greatest importance.</p>

<p><b>1. Name Beginning.</b>&mdash;The proper name beginning
is very common. It is always used when any one
of prominence is involved in the story or when the
name, although unknown, can be made interesting
in itself&mdash;as in a human interest story. The name is
usually made the subject of the verb testified, as in
this lead:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">A. F. Law, secretary of the Temple
Iron Company, a subsidiary company
of the Reading Coal and Iron Company,
called before the government investigation
of the alleged combination
of coal carrying roads, testified today
in the Federal building that four roads
had contributed $488,000 to make up the
deficit of the Temple company during
three years of coal strikes.&mdash;<em>New York
Sun.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
The name of a well-known company often makes a
good beginning:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The Standard Oil Company sent a
sweeping broadside into the Government's
case yesterday at the hearing in
the suit seeking to dissolve the Standard
Oil Company of New Jersey under the
Sherman anti-trust law, when witnesses
began to tell of the character of a number
of men the Government had placed
upon the witness stand.&mdash;<em>New York
Times.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The name of the judge himself may be used in the
first line:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Judge Mulqueen of General Sessions
explained today why he had sentenced
two prisoners to "go home and serve
time with the families." This punishment
was imposed yesterday when both
men pleaded drunkenness as their excuse
for trivial offenses.&mdash;<em>New York
Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>2. Continued Case Beginning.</b>&mdash;Many court reports
begin with the name of the case when the case
has been running for some time and is well known.
Each individual story on such a case is just a continuation
of a sort of serial story that has been running
for some time and in the lead each day the reporter
tries to summarize the progress that has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
made in the case during the day's hearing. However
each story, like a follow-up story, is written in
such a way that a knowledge of previous stories is
not necessary to a clear understanding:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The hearing yesterday in the Government's
suit to dissolve the Standard
Oil Company ended with a dramatic incident.
Mr. Kellogg sought to show
that the Standard compelled a widow,
Mrs. Jones, of Mobile, Ala., to sell out
her little oil business at a ruinous sacrifice.&mdash;<em>New
York World.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">In some cases this sort of a lead begins with the
mere mention of the continuing of the trial:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">At the opening of the defence today
in the sugar trials before Judge Martin
of the United States Circuit Court,
James F. Bendernagal took the witness
chair in his own behalf, etc.&mdash;<em>New York
Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>3. Summary Beginning.</b>&mdash;The lead of a court report
often begins with a brief summary of the result
of the trial or of the day's hearing:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">What the Government has characterized
as "unfair competition and discrimination"
on the part of the Standard
Oil Company continued to be the
subject of the investigation of that corporation
today before Franklin Ferris
of St. Louis, referee, in the Custom
House.&mdash;<em>New York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
The summary may be presented in as formal a way
as the <em>that</em>-clause beginning which we used in reports
of speeches:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">That the Adams' Express Company's
business in New England in 1909 yielded
a profit representing 45 per cent. on
the investment, including real estate
and, excepting real estate, a net income
of more than 83 per cent., came out in
the course of the hearing before the
Interstate Commerce Commission, etc.&mdash;<em>New
York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>4. Direct Quotation Beginning.</b>&mdash;A direct quotation
of some striking statement made by the judge,
by a lawyer, by a witness, or by any one connected
with the trial may be used at the beginning of the
lead. Here is a lead beginning with a quotation
from the title of a case:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"Captain Dick and Captain Lewis, Indians,
for and on behalf of the Yokayo
tribe of Indians, vs. F. C. Albertson, T.
J. Weldon, as administrator of the estate
of Charley, Indian, deceased, Minnehaha,
Ollagoola, Hiawatha, Wanahana,
Pocahontas, etc."</p>

<p class="nt nb">So runs the title of as unusual a case
as jurists, etc.&mdash;<em>San Francisco Examiner.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>5. Human Interest Beginning.</b>&mdash;The human interest
beginning is a more or less free beginning which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
may be used in the reporting of rather insignificant
cases which are of value only for the human interest
in them. The beginning is capable of almost
any treatment so long as it brings out the humor,
beauty, or pathos of the situation. Sometimes the
story begins with a rather striking summary of the
unusual things that came out in the testimony, as
in this case:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">How suddenly and how radically a
woman can exercise her inalienable prerogative
and change her mind is shown
in the testamentary disposition made of
her estate by Mrs. Jennie L. Ramsay.
She made a will on July 4 last, at 3
o'clock in the afternoon, leaving her
property to her husband, and at 7 o'clock
in the evening of the same day she
made another will in which she took
the property away from her husband.&mdash;<em>New
York Times.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Here is an interesting illustration of the use of a
trivial incident as the basis for a humorous lead:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Bang, an English setter dog, accused
of biting 11-year-old Sophie Kahn, made
an excellent witness in the City Court
today when his owner, Hirman L.
Phelps, a real estate dealer of the
Bronx, appeared as defendant in a damage
suit brought by the girl for $2,000.&mdash;<em>New
York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The lead of a report of legal proceedings is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
much like the lead of a report of a speech or an
interview. It always begins with the most interesting
fact in the case and briefly summarizes the result
of the trial or the day's hearing. It is to be noted
that the lead of such a story always includes a designation
of the court in which the hearing was held
and usually the name of the judge and of the case.</p>

<p>After the lead is finished a court report usually
turns into a running story of the evidence as it
was presented. This may be condensed into a paragraph,
giving the reader merely the point of the
day's hearing, or it may be expanded into several
columns following the testimony more or less closely.
In form, it is very much like the summary paragraphs
in the body of a speech report. The result
is usually more or less dry and reporters often resort
to a means, similar to dialogue in fiction, to
lighten it up. Some of the more important testimony
is given verbatim interspersed with indirect
summaries of the longer or less important speeches.
Its presentation usually follows the ordinary rules
of dialogue. Here is an extract from such a story:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">After describing himself as a breeder
of horses, Gideon said that he was a
member of the Metropolitan Turf Association,
the bookmakers' organization,
but had never been engaged in bookmaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
He did not know where "Eddie"
Burke, "Tim" Sullivan (not the
politician), or any of the other missing
"bookies" could be found.</p>

<p class="nt nb">"You are a member of the executive
committee of the Metropolitan Turf
Association?" asked Isidor J. Kresel,
assistant counsel of the committee.</p>

<p class="nt nb">"Yes."</p>

<p class="nt nb">"Now, what did your committee do
in 1908, when the anti-race track legislation
was pending?"</p>

<p class="nt nb">"I don't know."</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p class="nt nb">"How much did you pay in 1908?"</p>

<p class="nt nb">"Two hundred and fifty dollars."</p>

<p class="nt nb">"To whom?"</p>

<p class="nt nb">"Mr. Sullivan."</p>

<p class="nt nb">"What for?"</p>

<p class="nt nb">"Death assessments."</p>

<p class="nt nb">Gideon said that the little he knew of
the doings of the "Mets" was from conversation
with the bookies. Etc., etc.&mdash;<em>New
York Evening Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Sometimes this direct testimony is given, not in the
dialogue form, but as questions and answers. Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">In reply to other questions, Bendernagel
said he ordered the office supplies,
looked after the insurance on the sugar,
and was responsible for the fuel, some
700 tons of coal a day.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Question.&mdash;How much money was
paid through your office in the course
of a year? Answer.&mdash;Four million dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p class="nt nb">Q.&mdash;So yours was a busy office?
A.&mdash;Exceedingly so.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Q.&mdash;How long were the raw sugar
clerks in your office? A.&mdash;About twenty
years. Etc., etc.&mdash;<em>New York Evening
Post.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Some papers would arrange these questions and answers
differently, paragraphing each speech separately
as in dialogue:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Question.&mdash;Did you regulate their duties
in any way?</p>

<p class="nt nb">Answer.&mdash;No.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Q.&mdash;Were you connected with the
docks?</p>

<p class="nt nb">A.&mdash;No; that was a separate department.
It had its own forces, and they
worked under Mr. Spitzer. He had entire
charge. Etc., etc.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The court records take cognizance only of the actual
words uttered in the testimony, but a newspaper reporter
never fails to record any action or movement
that indicates something beyond the words. Very
often action is brought in merely for its human interest;
thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"How long has it been since you have
had a maid?" asked Mr. Shearn sadly.</p>

<p class="nt nb">"Not for some time," she said. "Away
back in 1907, I think."</p>

<p class="nt nb">"What did it cost you for two rooms
and bath at the Hotel Belmont, where
you lived last year?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p class="nt nb">"About $300 a week altogether. The
rooms cost $20 a day."</p>

<p class="nt nb">There were tears in her eyes when
she explained that she could no longer
afford to keep up her own automobile.
Etc., etc.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">This sort of dialogue is dangerous and may easily
be overworked, but it is very often extremely effective.
One word like "sadly," above, may convey
more meaning than many lines of explanation.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p>These quotations are usually interspersed with
paragraphs which summarize the unimportant intervening
testimony. The running story attempts to
follow the progress of the hearing in greater or less
detail, depending upon the space given to the story,
just as a speech report attempts to follow a public
discourse. Dry and unimportant facts are briefly
summarized, interesting parts of the testimony are
quoted in full. The running story is usually written
while the hearing is in session or taken from a
stenographic report of the hearing. After the running
story has been completed, the reporter prepares
a lead for the beginning to summarize the
results or to play up the most significant part of
the story. If the running story is short a lead of
one paragraph is sufficient, but if it is long, the
lead may be expanded into several paragraphs.</p>

<br />
<small>SOCIAL NEWS AND OBITUARIES</small></h2>


<p>The study of newspaper treatment of social news
is a broad one. Every newspaper has its own system
of handling social news and the general tendencies
that are to be noted deal rather with the
facts that are printed than with the manner of
treatment. Every newspaper gives practically the
same facts about a wedding but each individual newspaper
has a method of its own of writing up those
facts. One thing that is always true of social news
reporting is that the amount of space given to social
items varies inversely with the importance of the
newspaper and the size of the city in which it is
printed. A little country weekly or semi-weekly
in a small town does not hesitate to run two columns
or more on Sadie Smith's wedding. The report
runs into minute details and anecdotes that all of
the "Weekly's" readers know before the paper arrives.
But the editor prints everything he can find
or invent simply because all of his readers are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
or less personally connected with the affair and are
anxious to see their names in print and to read
about themselves. The liberty that such an editor
gives himself is of course impossible in a larger
paper.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a daily in a city of average
size would reduce such a story to a stickful and a
metropolitan daily would run only a one-line announcement
in the "List of marriages," unless the
story was especially interesting. The same thing
applies to all social stories. Some metropolitan
newspapers do not run social news at all.</p>

<p>All of this is true because social news is governed
by the same principles that regulate all news
values. Unless a society event has some feature
that is interesting impersonally&mdash;that is, of interest
to readers who do not know the principals of the
event&mdash;it is of value only as a larger or smaller number
of the paper's readers are personally connected
with the event. Hence in a small town where every
one knows every one else, society news is of great
value. In a large city a very small proportion of
the readers are connected with the social items that
the paper has to print and are therefore not interested
in them&mdash;accordingly the newspaper either
cuts them down to a minimum of space or does not
run them at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore in our study society news falls into two
classes: social items that are of interest only in
themselves to persons connected with the events;
and big society stories or unusual social events that
are of interest to readers who are not acquainted
with the principals.</p>

<p><b>1. Weddings.</b>&mdash;The wedding story reduced to its
lowest terms in a metropolitan paper consists of a
one-line announcement in the list of "Marriages"
or "Marriage Licenses"; thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">SMITH-JONES&mdash;Feb. 14, Katherine
Jones to Charles C. Smith.&mdash;<em>New York
Times.</em></p>
</div>

<p>If the paper runs a few columns of social news
and the persons concerned in the wedding are of any
importance socially, the wedding may be given a
stickful. Such an account would confine itself entirely
to names and facts and would be characterized
by very decided simplicity and brevity. Usually
nothing more would be given than the names and
address of the bride's parents, the bride's first name,
the groom's name, the place, and the name of the
minister who officiated. Occasionally the name of
the best man and a few other details are added, but
never does the story become personal. It is interesting
only to those who know or know of the persons
concerned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="c nt nb">SMITH-JONES</p>

<p class="nt nb">The marriage of Miss Katherine M.
Jones, elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Randolph Jones, 253 Ninth street, and
Charles C. Smith was celebrated at 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon at the First
Methodist Church, 736 Grand avenue.
Rev. William Brown, rector of the
church, performed the ceremony.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">It will be noted that in the above story the name of
the bride is written out in full, "Miss Katherine M.
Jones." Many newspapers, however, would simply
give her first name, thus: "Katherine, elder daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Jones."</p>

<p>If the above wedding were of greater importance
more details might be given. These would include
the attendants, descriptions of the gowns of the
bride and her attendants, the guests from out of
town, music, decorations, the reception, and perhaps
some of the presents. Sometimes the wedding trip
and an announcement of when and where the couple
will be at home are added. The above story might
run on into detail something like this:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Miss Jones, who was given in marriage
by her father, wore a white satin
gown trimmed with Venetian point lace,
and her point lace veil, a family heirloom,
was caught with orange blossoms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
She carried a bouquet of white sweet
peas and lilies of the valley. Miss Dorothy
Jones, a sister of the bride, who
was maid of honor, wore a gown of
green chiffon over satin, with lingerie
hat, and carried sweet peas. Douglas
Jackson was the best man and the
ushers were Dr. John B. Smith, Samuel
Smith, Gordon Hunt, Rodney Dexter,
Norris Kenny, and Arthur Johnston. A
reception followed the ceremony at the
home of the bride's parents.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">This is probably as long a story as any average
paper would run on any wedding, unless the wedding
had some striking feature that would make the
story of interest to readers who did not know the
principals. Note in the foregoing story the simplicity
and impersonal tone. There is a wealth of
facts but there is no coloring. This tone should
characterize every society story. A list of out-of-town
guests might have been added, but as often
that would be omitted. In some cases the last sentence
might be followed by an announcement like
this:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The bride and bridegroom have gone
on a wedding tour of the West; after
April 1 they will be at home at 76 Kimbark
avenue.</p>
</div>

<p>In this connection the young reporter should note
the distinctions in meaning of the various words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
used in a wedding story. For instance, he should
consult the dictionary for the exact use of the verbs
"to marry" and "to wed"&mdash;he should know who "is
married," who "is married to," and who "is given
in marriage," etc. He should also know the difference
between a "marriage" and a "wedding."</p>

<p><b>2. Wedding Announcements.</b>&mdash;Wedding announcements
are run in the social columns of many papers.
These items contain practically the same facts that
we find in the story written after the wedding, except,
of course, that the reporter cannot dilate on
decorations, and must stick to facts. These facts
usually consist of the names of the couple, the names
of the bride's parents, and the time and the place of
the wedding. Additionally the reporter may give
the minister's name, the names of the maid of honor
and of the best man, the reception or breakfast to
follow, and where the couple will be at home.</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The wedding of Miss Gladys Jones
and Richard Smith will take place on
Wednesday evening in All Angels'
Church. The bride is a daughter of
Mrs. Charles Jones, who will give a
bridal supper and reception afterward at
her home.</p>
</div>

<p>There are of course many other ways to begin
the announcement. "Miss Mary E. MacGuire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
daughter of, etc."; "Invitations have been issued for
the wedding of Miss, etc."; "One of the weddings
on for Tuesday is that of Miss, etc."; "Cards are
out for the wedding on Saturday of Miss, etc."; and
many others. In each case the bride's name has the
place of importance.</p>

<p><b>3. Announcements of Engagements.</b>&mdash;Announcements
of engagements are usually even briefer than
wedding announcements. The item consists merely
of one sentence in which the young lady's mother
or parents make the announcement with the name
of the prospective groom.</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Mrs. Russell D. Jones of 45 Ninth
street announces the engagement of her
daughter, Natalie, to John MacBaine
Smith.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The item may also begin "Mr. and Mrs. X. X. So-and-So
announce, etc.," or simply "Announcement
is made of the engagement of Miss Stella Blank,
daughter of, etc."</p>

<p><b>4. Receptions and Other Entertainments.</b>&mdash;If a paper
is to keep up in society news, it must report many
social entertainments. However, such events are
treated by large dailies as simply, briefly, and impersonally
as possible. Such a story, like the report
of a wedding, consists merely of certain usual facts.
The name of the host or hostess, the place, the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and the special entertainments are of course always
included. Sometimes the occasion for the event,
the guests of honor, and a description of the decorations
are added,&mdash;also the names of those who assisted
the hostess.</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Mrs. James Harris Jones gave a reception
yesterday at her home, 136 Fifth
street, for her daughter, Miss Dorothy
Jones. In the receiving line were Miss
Marjorie Smith, Miss, etc. * * The reception
was followed by an informal dance.</p>
</div>

<p>If the event is held especially for d&eacute;butantes, the
fact is noted at the very start. "A number of d&eacute;butantes
assisted in receiving at a tea given by, etc.";
"The d&eacute;butantes of the winter were out in force,
etc."</p>

<p>Such a story is usually followed by a list of guests,
a list of out-of-town guests, a list of subscribers,
or something of the sort. Ordinarily the list is not
tabulated but is run in solid, thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The guests were: Miss Kathleen
Smith, Miss Georgia Brown, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Very often the names are grouped together, thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">The guests were: The Misses Kathleen
Smith, Georgia Brown; Mesdames
Robert R. Green, John R. Jones; and the
Messrs. George Hamilton, Francis
Bragg, etc.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
The number of variations in such stories is limited
only by the ingenuity of the people who are giving
such entertainments. But in each case the reporter
learns to give the same facts in much the
same order. And he gives them in an uncolored, impersonal
way that makes the items interesting only
to those who are directly connected with them. The
story may vary from a single sentence to half a
column, but it always begins in the same way and
elaborates only the same details. Before trying to
write up social entertainments, a reporter should
always be sure of the use of the various words he
employs&mdash;"chaperon," "patroness," etc. For instance,
can we say that "Mr. and Mrs. Smith acted
as chaperons"?</p>

<p><b>5. Social Announcements.</b>&mdash;Social announcements
of any kind are usually, like the wedding and engagement
announcements, confined to a single sentence.
They tell only the name of the host and
hostess, the name of the guest of honor or the occasion
for the event, the time, and the place. Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Mrs. Charles P. Jones will give a
dance this evening at her home, 181
Nineteenth street, to introduce her sister,
Miss Elsie Holt.</p>
</div>

<p>A study of the foregoing sections on society stories
shows how definitely a reporter is restricted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the facts that he may include in his social items&mdash;how
conventional social stories have become. This
very restraint in the matter of facts makes it the
more necessary for a reporter to exercise his originality
in the diction of social items. He must guard
against the use of certain set expressions, like "officiating,"
"performed the ceremony," and "solemnized."
While restricted in the facts that he may
give, he must try to present the same old facts in
new and interesting ways&mdash;he may even resort to
a moderate use of "fine writing," if he does not become
florid or frivolous.</p>

<p><b>6. Unusual Social Stories.</b>&mdash;Just as soon as any of
these stories contains a feature that is of interest
to the general public in an impersonal way it leaves
the general class of social news and becomes a news
story to be written with the usual lead. Even the
presence of a very prominent name will make a
news story out of a social item. For instance, the
wedding of Miss Ethel Barrymore was written by
many papers as a news story. On the other hand,
an unusual marriage, an unusual elopement, or anything
unusual and interesting in a wedding gives
occasion for a news story. Here is one:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Because their 15-year-old daughter,
Sarah, married a man other than the
one they had chosen, who is wealthy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Mr. and Mrs. Markovits of 3128 Cedar
street have gone into deep mourning,
draped their home in crepe and announced
to their friends that Sarah is
dead.&mdash;<em>Philadelphia Ledger.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Or the story may be handled in a more humorous
way, thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">There is really no objection to him,
and she is quite a nice young woman,
but to be married so young, and to go
on a wedding journey with $18 in their
purses&mdash;but Wallace Jones, student of
the Western University, and Ruth
Smith, student in the McKinley High
School, decided it was too long a time
to wait, and a nice old pastor gentleman
in St. Joe has made them one.&mdash;<em>Milwaukee
Free Press.</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>7. Obituaries.</b>&mdash;Like many other classes of newspaper
stories, the obituary has developed a conventional
form which is followed more or less rigidly
by all the papers of the land. Every obituary follows
the same order and tells the same sort of facts
about its subject. It begins with a brief account of
the deceased man's death, runs on through a very
condensed account of the professional side of his
life and ends with the announcement of his funeral
or a list of his surviving relatives.</p>

<p>The lead is concerned only with his death, answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the usual questions about <em>where</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>why</em>,
and is written to stand alone if necessary. It ordinarily
begins with the man's full name, because
of course the name is the most important thing in
the story, and then tells who he was and where he
lived. This is followed, perhaps in the same sentence,
by the time of his death, the cause, and perhaps
the circumstances. Thus:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 25.&mdash;Dr.
John H. Blank, professor of Greek at
Harvard since 1887 and dean of the
Graduate School since 1895, died at his
home in Quincy street today from heart
trouble. Professor Blank was an authority
on classical subjects.&mdash;<em>New
York Tribune.</em></p>
</div>

<p>This, as you see, might stand alone and be complete
in itself. Many obituaries, however, add another
paragraph after the lead in which the circumstances
of the death are discussed in greater detail.
Here is the second paragraph of another obituary:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">At 8:30 tonight Mr. Blank was walking
with his wife on the veranda of the
Delmonte Hotel, when he suddenly
gasped as if in great pain and fell to
the floor. He was carried inside, but
was dead before the physicians reached
his bedside. Apoplexy is said to have
been the cause.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Next comes the account of the deceased man's
life. It is told very briefly and impersonally and
concerns itself chiefly with the events of his business
or professional activities. It is but a catalogue
of his achievements and the dates of those achievements.
These facts are usually obtained from the
file of biographies&mdash;called the morgue&mdash;which most
newspapers keep. The account first tells when and
where he was born and perhaps who his parents
were. Next his education is briefly discussed. Then
the chief events of his professional or business life.
The date of his marriage and the maiden name of
his wife are included somewhere in or at the end
of this account. Usually a list of the organizations
of which the man was a member and a list of the
books which he had written are attached to this account.
One of the foregoing obituaries continues as
follows:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">He was born in Urumiah, Persia, on
February 4, 1852, being the son of the
Rev. Austin H. Blank, a missionary.
He was graduated from Dartmouth in
1873, and that college awarded him the
degrees of A. M. in 1876 and LL.D. in
1901. From 1876 to 1878 he studied at
Leipzig University. He was assistant
professor of ancient languages at the
Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College
from 1873 to 1876, associate professor
of Greek at Dartmouth from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
1878 to 1880, and dean of the collegiate
board and professor of classical philology
at Johns Hopkins in 1886 and
1887. In 1906 and 1907 he served as
professor in the American School of
Classical Studies in Athens.</p>

<p class="nt nb">(Then follows a list of the organizations
of which he was a member and
the periodicals with which he was connected.)</p>

<p class="nt nb">He married Miss Mary Blank, daughter
of the president of Blank College,
in 1879, and she survives him.&mdash;<em>New
York Tribune.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The obituary usually ends with a list of surviving
relatives&mdash;especially children and very often the
funeral arrangements are included. This is the last
paragraph of another obituary:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">His first wife, Mary V. Blank, died
in 1872. Three years later he married
Mrs. Sarah A. Blank, of Hightstown,
N. J., who with four daughters, survives
him. The funeral will be held
tomorrow at 11:30 o'clock. The burial
will be in the family plot in Greenwood
Cemetery.</p>
</div>

<p>This is the standard form of the obituary which
is followed by most daily newspapers in fair-sized
cities. The form is characterized by an extreme conciseness
and brevity and an absolutely impersonal
tone. Very rightly, an obituary is handled with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
sense of the sanctified character of its subject It
offers no opportunity for fine writing or human interest;
it simply gives the facts as briefly and impersonally
as possible.</p>

<br />
<small>SPORTING NEWS</small></h2>


<p>Division of labor on the larger American newspapers
has made the reporting of athletic and sporting
events into a separate department under a separate
editor. The pink or green sporting sheets of
the big papers have become separate little newspapers
in themselves handled by a sporting editor
and his staff and entirely devoted to athletic news,
except when padded out with left-over stories from
other pages. Although on smaller papers any reporter
may be called upon to cover an athletic event,
in the cities such news is handled entirely by experts
who are thoroughly acquainted with all phases of
the athletic sports about which they write. The
stories on the pink sheet enjoy the greatest unconventionality
of form to be seen anywhere in the
paper except on the editorial page. And yet, because
athletic reporters are usually men taken from
regular reporting and because the same ideas and
necessities of news values govern the sporting pages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
athletic stories follow, in general, the usual news
story form.</p>

<p>One may expect to find under the head of sports
almost any news that is any way connected with college,
amateur, or professional athletics. The stories
include accounts of baseball and football games, rowing,
horse racing, track meets, boxing, and many
other forms of sport, as well as any discussions or
movements growing out of these sports. Many of
the stories are only a few lines in length while others
may cover a column or more. But in general each
one has a lead which answers the questions <em>when?</em>
<em>where?</em> <em>how?</em> <em>who?</em> and <em>why?</em> and runs along much
like an ordinary news story. For, after all, even
athletic stories are written to attract and to hold
the reader's interest whether or not he is directly
interested in the sport under discussion. Any reporter
who is called upon to cover an athletic event
is safe in writing his story in the usual news story
form.</p>

<p>As it would be impossible to discuss all the various
stories that come under the head of athletic news,
the reporting of college football games will be taken
as typical of the others. The rules that are suggested
for the reporting of football games may be
applied to baseball games, track meets, and other
sporting events. The same principles govern all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of them and the stories usually summarize results
in about the same way. Football stories may be
divided into three general classes: the brief summary
story of a stickful or a trifle more; the
usual football story of a half column or less; and
the long story that may be run through a column
or more, depending upon the importance of the
game.</p>

<p>All three of these stories are alike in the
general facts which they contain; they differ only
in the number of minor details which they include
in the elaboration of these general facts. Each one
tells in the first sentence what teams were competing,
the final score, when and where the game was played,
and perhaps some striking feature of the game&mdash;the
weather, the conditions of the field, the star players,
or a sensational score. After that, with more or less
expansion, each of the stories gives the essential
things that the reader wants to know about the
game. These consist usually of the way in which the
scoring was done, a comparison of the playing of the
teams, a list of the star players, the weather conditions,
and the crowd. If the writing of the story
includes a discussion of each of these points in more
or less detail, the game will be covered in all of its
essential phases. The three kinds of stories differ,
from one another, not in the facts that they include,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
but in the length at which they expand upon these
facts. One rule should be noted in the writing of all
these stories or of any athletic story&mdash;avoid superlatives.
To a green reporter almost every game seems
to be "the most spectacular," "the most thrilling,"
"the hardest fought," "the most closely matched,"
but a broad experience is necessary to defend the
use of any superlative about the game.</p>

<p><b>1. The Brief Summary Story.</b>&mdash;This is the little
story of a stickful or less, which merely announces
the result of some distant or unimportant game.
Taken in its shortest form it gives only the names
of the teams, the score, the time and place of the
game, and perhaps a word or two of general characterization.
As it is allowed to expand in length it
takes up as briefly as possible the following facts
in the order in which they are given: the scoring,
the comparison of play, the star players or plays.
It is a mere announcement of the result of the game
and no more, for that is all the reader wants. The
line-ups and other tables are usually omitted, and
nothing is included that goes beyond this narrow
purpose. Here are a few examples:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">IOWA CITY, Ia., Nov. 25.&mdash;Sensational
end runs by McGinnis and Curry
near the end of the final quarter of
play gave Iowa a 6-to-0 victory over
Northwestern here this afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p class="nt nb">Fort Atkinson High School defeated
Madison High today in the final moments
of play when a punt by Davy,
fullback for Madison, was blocked and
the ball recovered behind the line, giving
Fort Atkinson the game, 2 to 0.</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">INDIANAPOLIS, June 3.&mdash;Indianapolis
started its at-home series today by
defeating Kansas City, 3 to 2. Robertson
was in fine form, striking out five
men, permitting no one to walk and
allowing only six hits. Score: (Tables.)</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">LAFAYETTE, Ind., June 1.&mdash;With
the score 41 1-3 points, athletes representing
the University of California won
the twelfth annual meet of the Western
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
Association today.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Missouri was second with 29 1-3
points, Illinois third with 26, Chicago
fourth with 15 and Wisconsin fifth with
12 1-2.</p>
</div>

<p><b>2. The Usual Football Story.</b>&mdash;The usual report
of a game is a story of a half column or less which
is longer than the brief summary story and not so
detailed as the long football story. This is the story
that a correspondent would usually send to his paper.
It is like them both in the facts that it includes and
differs only in length and in manner of treatment.
This story is usually divided into two parts: the
introduction and the running account. The introduction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
or lead, is very much like the brief summary
story; in fact, the entire brief summary story
might be used as the introduction of a story of this
type. The second part, the running account, corresponds
to the running account of the game as it
will be taken up with the long football story.</p>

<p>The introduction of the usual athletic story
always contains certain facts. The first sentence,
corresponding to the lead of a news story, always
gives the names of the teams, the score, the time,
the place, and the most striking feature of the game.
After this the plays that resulted in scores are described
and the star plays or players are enumerated.
Usually a comparison of the two teams, as to weight,
speed, and playing, follows, and the opinion of the
captain or of some coach may be included. The rest
of the introduction may be devoted to the picturesque
side of the game: the crowd, the cheering, the
celebration, etc. All of this must be told briefly in
200 words or less. The introduction is simply the
brief summary story slightly expanded. Here is a
fair example (the paragraph containing the scoring
has been omitted):</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Purdue triumphed over Indiana today,
12 to 5, recording the first victory
for the Boilermakers over the Crimson
in five years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p class="nt nb">(Omitted paragraph on scoring belongs
here.)</p>

<p class="nt nb">Purdue played a great game at all
times. Oliphant, right half-back on the
Boilermaker eleven, played remarkably
well and was the hardest man for the
locals to handle. Baugh, Miller, Winston
and Capt. Tavey also starred for
Coach Hoit's men.</p>

<p class="nt nb">The Lafayette rooters, 1,500 strong,
rushed on the field at the close of the
struggle and carried their players off
the field.</p>
</div>

<p>This is ordinarily followed by a brief running
account of the game. It does not attempt to follow
every play or to trace the course of the ball throughout
the entire game, as a complete running account
would do. It is usually made from the detailed running
account by a process of elimination so that
nothing but the "high spots" of the game is left.
Such an account may run from 200 to 300 words in
length. At the end tables are usually printed to
give the line-up and the tabulated results of the
game, but these may sometimes be omitted. The
following is an extract from a condensed running
account:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Again the cadets fought their way
to the 10-yard line, runs by Rose and
Patterson helping materially, but again
Wayland held. The half ended after
Wayland had kicked out of danger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p class="nt nb">In the second half St. John's outplayed
Wayland throughout. The cadets
by a succession of line plunges
took the ball within striking distance
several times, only to be held for downs
or lose it on a fumble.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Patterson electrified the crowd just
before the third quarter ended by twice
dodging through for 20-yard runs, placing
the ball on the 15-yard line, where
the cadets were held for downs.</p>
</div>

<p><b>3. Long Football Story.</b>&mdash;The third class of football
story is the long detailed account. This is all
that is left of the elaborate write-ups of the season's
big games that were printed a few years ago and
may be seen occasionally now. Ten or twenty years
ago it was not unusual for an editor to run several
pages, profusely illustrated, on a big eastern football
game. The story was written up from every
possible aspect&mdash;athletic, social, picturesque, etc.
Every play was described in detail and sometimes
a graphic diagram of the play was inserted. Each
phase was handled by a different reporter and the
whole thing was given a prominence in the paper
out of all proportion with its real importance. Such
a treatment of athletic news has now been very
largely discarded.</p>

<p>The outgrowth of this elaborate treatment is the
common one- or two-column account in the pink or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
green sporting pages. All of the various aspects
of the big game are still to be seen, condensed to
the smallest amount of space; and this brief account
of the different aspects of the game is arranged as
an introduction of a half column or less to head the
running account of the game. This is the sort of
story that is used to report the Yale-Harvard games
and the more important middle western games. Its
form has become very definitely settled and a correspondent
can almost write his story of the big
game by rule.</p>

<p>The first part of the story, called the introduction,
consists of five or six general paragraphs. The material
in this introduction is arranged, paragraph by
paragraph, in the order of its importance. Following
this is a running account of the game which
may occupy a column or more, depending upon the
importance of the contest. At the end is a table
showing the line-up and a summary of the results.</p>

<p>The introduction of the big football or baseball
story usually follows a very definite order. There
are certain things which it must always contain:
the result of the game; how the scoring was done;
a characterization of the playing; the stars; the condition
of the weather and the field; the crowd; etc.
The reader always wishes to know these things
about the game even if he does not care to read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
running account. It is equally evident that the
scoring is of greater interest than the crowd, and
that a comparison of the teams is more important
than the cheering. And so a reporter may almost
follow a stereotyped outline in writing his account.
A possible outline would be something like this:</p>

<p class="hang">First Paragraph.&mdash;The names of the teams, the
score, when and where the game was played, and
perhaps some striking feature of the game. The
weather may have been a significant factor, or
the condition of the field; the crowd may have
been exceptionally large or small, enthusiastic or
uninterested; or the game may have decided a
championship; some star may have been unusually
prominent, or the scoring may have been done
in an extraordinary way. Any of these factors,
if of sufficient significance, would be played up in
the first line just as the feature of an ordinary
news story is played up. This paragraph corresponds
to the lead of a news story and is so
written. For example:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Playing ankle-deep in mud before a
wildly enthusiastic gathering of football
rooters, the gridiron warriors of
Siwash College defeated the Tigers this
afternoon on Siwash athletic field by the
score of 5 to 0.</p>
</div>

<p class="hang">Second Paragraph.&mdash;Here the reporter usually tells
how the scoring was done, what players made
the scores, and how.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang">Third Paragraph.&mdash;The next thing of importance
is a comparison of the two teams. The reader
wants to know how they compared in weight,
speed, and skill, and how each one rose to the
fight. A general characterization of the playing
or a criticism may not be out of place here.</p>

<p class="hang">Fourth Paragraph.&mdash;Now we are ready to tell about
the individual players. Our readers want to know
who the stars were and how they starred.</p>

<p class="hang">Fifth Paragraph.&mdash;This brings us down near the
tag end of the introduction. Very often this
paragraph is devoted to the opinions of the captains
and coaches on the game. Their statements,
if significant, may be boxed and run anywhere
in the report.</p>

<p class="hang">Sixth Paragraph.&mdash;The picturesque and social side
of the game comes in here. The size of the crowd,
the enthusiasm, the celebration between halves
or before or after the game, are usually told.
This material may be of enough importance to
occupy several paragraphs, but the reporter must
always remember that he is writing a sporting
account and not a picturesque description of a
social event.</p>

<p class="hang">Seventh Paragraph.&mdash;This paragraph usually begins
the running account of the game.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p class="hang">N-th Paragraph.&mdash;This space at the end of the
entire report is given to the line-ups and tabulated
results of the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
This arrangement may of course be varied, and
any of the foregoing factors of the game may be
of sufficient importance to be placed earlier in the
story. Never, however, should the various factors
be mixed together heterogeneously and written in
a confused mass. Each element must be taken up
separately and occupy a paragraph by itself.</p>

<p>The running account of the game, which follows
the introduction, requires little rhetorical skill.
Each play is described in its proper place and order
and should be so clear that a reader could make a
diagram of the game from it. It must also be accurate
in names and distances as well as in plays.</p>

<p>Probably every individual sporting correspondent
has a different way of distinguishing the players
and the plays and of writing his running account.
It is not an easy matter to watch a game from the
press stand far up in the bleachers and be able to
tell who has the ball in each play and how many
yards were gained or lost. Familiarity with the teams
and the individual players makes the task easier
but few reporters are so favored by circumstances.
They must get the names from the cheering or from
other reporters about them unless they have some
method of their own.</p>

<p>There is one method that may be followed with
some success. Before the game the reporter equips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
himself with a table of the players showing them
in their respective places as the two teams line up.
It is usually impossible to tell who has the ball during
any single play because the eye cannot follow
the rapid passing, but it is always possible to tell
who has the ball when it is downed. At the end of
each play as the players line up, the reporter keeps
his eye on the man who had the ball when it was
downed and watches to see the position he takes
in the new line-up. Then a glance at the table will
tell him the man's name.</p>

<p>The running account is written as simply and
briefly as possible. It follows each play, telling
what play was made, who had the ball, and what the
result was. It keeps a record of all the time taken
out, the changes in players, the injuries, etc. A
typical running account reads something like this:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Siwash advanced the ball two yards
by a line plunge. Kelley carried the ball
around left end for five yards to the
Tigers' 50-yard line. The Tigers gained
the ball on a fumble after a fake punt
and lined up on their own 45-yard line.
Time called. Score at end of first half,
0 to 0.</p>
</div>

<p>At the end of the running account are tables, usually
set in smaller type, giving the line-up of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
two teams and the tabulated results of the game.
Some papers arrange the tables as follows:</p>

<div class="block">
<table class="sport" summary="Sport table">
<tr>
<td class="nt nb tdleft">Siwash:</td>
<td class="nt nb tdright" colspan="2">Tigers:</td>

<br />
<small>HUMAN INTEREST STORIES</small></h2>


<p>In our study of newspaper writing up to this
point we have been entirely concerned with forms,
rules, and formulas; every kind of story which we
have studied has had a definite form which we have
been charged to follow. We have been commanded
always to put the gist of the story in the first sentence
and to answer the reader's customary questions
in the same breath. Now we have come to a class
of newspaper stories in which we are given absolute
freedom from conventional formulas. In fact, the
human interest story is different from other newspaper
stories largely because of its lack of forms
and rules. It does not begin with the gist of its
news&mdash;perhaps because it rarely has any real news&mdash;and
it answers no customary questions in the first
paragraph; its method is the natural order of narrative.
The human interest story stands alone as
the only literary attempt in the entire newspaper
and, as such, a discussion of it can hardly tell more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
than what it is, without any great attempt to tell
how to write it. For our purposes, the distinguishing
marks of the human interest story are its lack
of real news value and of conventional form, and
its appeal to human emotions.</p>

<p>The human interest story has grown out of a
number of causes. Up to a very recent time newspapers
have been content with printing news in its
barest possible form&mdash;facts and nothing but facts.
Their appeal has been only to the brain. But gradually
editors have come to realize that, if many
monthly magazines can exist on a diet of fiction
that appeals only to the emotions, a newspaper may
well make use of some of the material for true
stories of emotion that comes to its office. They
have realized that newsiness is not the only essential,
that a story does not always have to possess true
news value to be worth printing&mdash;it may be interesting
because it appeals to the reader's sympathy
or simply because it entertains him. Hence they
began to print stories that had little value as news
but, however trivial their subject, were so well written
that they presented the humor and pathos of
everyday life in a very entertaining way. The sensational
newspapers took advantage of the opportunity
but they shocked their readers in that they
tried to appeal to the emotions through the kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
facts that they printed, rather than through the
presentation of the facts. They did not see that the
effectiveness of the emotional appeal depends upon
the way in which a human interest story is written,
rather than upon the story itself. Therefore they
shocked their readers with extremely pathetic facts
presented in the usual newspaper way, while the
journals which stood for high literary excellence
were able to handle trivial human interest material
very effectively. Now all the newspapers of the
land have learned the form and are printing effective
human interest stories every day.</p>

<p>Another reason behind the growth of the human
interest story is the curse of cynicism which newspaper
work imprints upon so many of its followers.
Every editor knows that no ordinary reporter can
work a police court or hospital run day after day
for any length of time without losing his sensibilities
and becoming hardened to the sterner facts in
human life. Misfortune and bitterness become so
common to him that he no longer looks upon them
as misfortune and misery, but just as news. Gradually
his stories lose all sympathy and kindliness
and he writes of suffering men as of so many wooden
ten-pins. When he has reached this attitude of cynicism,
his usefulness to his paper is almost gone, for
a reporter must always see and write the news from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the reader's sympathetic point of view. To keep
their reporters' sensibilities awake editors have tried
various expedients which have been more or less
successful. One of these is the "up-lift run" for cub
reporters&mdash;a round of philanthropic news sources to
teach them the business of reporting before they become
cynical. Another is the human interest story.
If a reporter knows that his paper is always ready
and glad to print human interest stories full of
kindliness and human sympathy, he is ever on the
watch for human interest subjects and consequently
forces himself to see things in a sympathetic way.
Thus he unconsciously wards off cynicism. The
search for human interest material is a modification
of the "sob squad" work of the sensational papers,
on more delicate lines.</p>

<p>A human interest story is primarily an attempt
to portray human feeling&mdash;to talk about men as men
and not as names or things. It is an attempt to look
upon life with sympathetic human eyes and to put
living people into the reports of the day's news. If
a man falls and breaks his neck, a bald recital of
the facts deals with him only as an animal or an
inanimate name. The fact is interesting as one
item in the list of human misfortunes, but no more.
And yet there are many people to whom this man's
accident is more than an interesting incident&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
is a very serious matter, perhaps a calamity. To
his family he was everything in the world; more
than a mere means of support, he was a living human
being whom they loved. The bald report of
his death does not consider them; it does not consider
the man's own previous existence. But if we
could get into the hearts of his wife and his mother
and his children, we could feel something of the
real significance of the accident. This is what the
human interest story tries to do. It does not necessarily
strive for any effect, pathetic or otherwise,
but tries simply to treat the victim of the misfortune
as a human being. The reporter endeavors to
see what in the story made people cry and then tries
to reproduce it. In the same way in another minor
occurrence, he attempts to reproduce the side of an
incident that made people laugh. Either incident
may or may not have had news value in its baldest
aspect, but the sympathetic treatment makes the resulting
human interest story worth printing.</p>

<p>There are various kinds of human interest stories.
The common ground in them all is usually
their lack of any intrinsic news value. Many a
successful human interest story has been printed
although it contained no one of the elements of
news values that were outlined earlier in this book.
In fact, one of the uses of the human interest story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
is to utilize newspaper by-products that have no news
value in themselves. Hence the human interest
story has no news feature to be played up and,
since it does not contain any real news, it does
not have to answer any customary questions. In
form it is much like a short story of fiction, since
it depends on style and the ordinary rules of narration.
The absence of a lead, more than any other
characteristic, distinguishes the human interest story
from the news story, in form. We have worked
hard to learn to play up the gist of the news in our
news stories; now we come to a story which makes
no attempt to play up its news&mdash;in fact, it may leave
its most interesting content until the end and spring
it as a surprise in the last line. To be sure, most
human interest stories have and indicate a timeliness.
The story may have no news value but it is
always concerned with a recent event and usually
tells at the outset when the event occurred. Almost
without exception, the examples quoted in this chapter
show their timeliness by telling in the first sentence
when the event occurred. So much for the
outward form of the human interest story.</p>

<p><b>1. Pathetic Story.</b>&mdash;One of the many kinds of human
interest stories is the pathetic story. Although
it does not openly strive for pathos, it is pathetic
in that it tells the story of a human misfortune, simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and clearly, with all the details that made the
incident sad. It is the story that attempts to put
the reader into the very reality of the pain and sorrow
of every human life. Sometimes it makes him
cry, sometimes it makes him shudder, and sometimes
it disgusts him, but it always shows him misfortune
as it really is. It looks down behind the outward
actions and words into the hearts of its actors and
shows us motives and feelings rather than facts.
But just as soon as any attempt at pathos becomes
evident, the story loses its effectiveness. Its only
means are clear perception and absolute truthfulness.
Here is an example of a pathetic human interest
story taken from a daily paper:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Rissa Sachs' child mind yesterday
evolved a tragic answer to the question,
"What shall be done with the children
of divorced parents?"</p>

<p class="nt nb">She took her life.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Rissa was 14 years old. The divorce
decree that robbed her of a home was
less than a week old. It was granted
to her mother, Mrs. Mellisa Sachs, by
Judge Brentano last Saturday.</p>

<p class="nt nb">When the divorce case was called for
trial Rissa found that she would be compelled
to testify. Reluctantly she corroborated
her mother's story that her
father, Benjamin Sachs, had struck Mrs.
Sachs. It was largely due to this testimony
that the decree was granted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the custody of the child awarded to Mrs.
Sachs.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Then the troubles of the girl began
in real earnest. She loved her mother
dearly. But her father, who had been
a companion to her as well as a parent,
was equally dear to her.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Both parents pleaded with her. Mrs.
Sachs told Rissa she could not live
without her. The father told the girl,
in a conversation in a downtown hotel
several days ago, that he would disown
her unless she went to live with him.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Every hour increased the perplexities
of the situation for the child. She could
not decide to give up either of her parents
for fear of offending the other.
So she sacrificed her own life and gave
up both.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Thursday evening, on returning from
school to the Sachs home at 4529 Racine
avenue, Rissa talked long and earnestly
with her mother. Then she retired
to her room, turned on the gas and,
clothed, lay down upon her bed to await
death and relief from troubles that have
driven older heads to despair.</p>

<p class="nt nb">At the inquest yesterday afternoon
the grief-stricken mother told the story
of her daughter's difficulties. She said
that Rissa had declared she could not
live if compelled to give up either of
her parents, but added that she never
had believed it.&mdash;<em>Chicago Record-Herald.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
This is a pathetic human interest story in that
it attempts to give the human significance of an incident
which in itself would have little news value.
Perhaps, in the matter of words, there is a slight
straining for pathos. The form, it will be noted,
is decidedly different from that of a news story on
the same incident and, although the timeliness is
given in the first line, there is no attempt to present
the gist of the story in a formal lead. The source
of the news is indicated in the last paragraph.</p>

<p><b>2. Humorous Story.</b>&mdash;Another kind of human interest
story is the humorous story. Its humor, like
the pathos of a pathetic story, does not come from
an attempt to be funny, but from the truthful presentation
of a humorous incident, from the incongruity
and ludicrousness of the incident itself. The
writer tries to see what elements in a given incident
made him laugh and then portrays them so clearly
and truthfully that his readers cannot help laughing
with him. The subject may be the most trivial
thing in the world, not worth a line as a news story,
and yet it may be told in such a way that it is worth
a half-column write-up that will stand out as the
gem of the whole edition. But after all the effectiveness
depends upon the humor in the original subject
and the truthfulness of the telling. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
humorous human interest story, which occupied
a place on the front page, was built up out of an
incident almost devoid of news value:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">One of Johnnie Wilt's original ideas
for entertaining his twin sister Charlotte
is to build a big bonfire on the floor of
their playroom.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Johnnie, who is 4 years old, carried
his plan into execution at the Wilt
home, 2474 Lake View avenue, for the
first time yesterday afternoon, with results
that made a lasting impression
upon his mind and the finishings of the
interior of the house.</p>

<p class="nt nb">The thing was suggested to him by a
bonfire he saw a man build in the street.
Charlotte hadn't seen the other fire.
For some reason Charlotte's feminine
mind refused to understand just what
the fire was like.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Consequently nothing remained for
Johnnie to do but build a fire of his
own. He piled all of the newspapers
and playthings that could be found in
the middle of the room and then applied
a match.</p>

<p class="nt nb">When the flames leaped to the ceiling,
however, and a cloud of smoke filled
the room, Johnnie began to doubt the
wisdom of the move. While Charlotte
ran to tell a maid he retreated to that
haven of youthful fugitives&mdash;the space
beneath a couch.</p>

<p class="nt nb">The frightened maid summoned the
fire engines and the fire was soon extinguished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
But Mrs. Wilt discovered
that Johnnie had disappeared. She telephoned
to Charles T. Wilt, president
of the trunk company that bears his
name, and half hysterically told of the
fire and the disappearance of Johnnie.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Just then there was a scrambling
sound from beneath the couch. Johnnie,
looking as serious as a 4-year-old
face can look, walked out.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Mrs. Wilt seized him and, to an accompaniment
of "I-won't-do-it-agains,"
crushed him to her bosom. Last reports
from the Wilt home were that Johnnie
had not yet been punished for his deed.&mdash;<em>Chicago
Record-Herald.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The student will notice how all the facts of the
story and the answers to the reader's questions are
worked in here and there, how the content of a
news story lead is scattered throughout the entire
account.</p>

<p><b>3. Writing the Human Interest Story.</b>&mdash;It is one
thing to be able to distinguish material for a human
interest story and another to be able to write the
story. The whole effectiveness of the story, as we
have seen, depends upon the way it is written.
Many a poorly written, ungrammatical news story is
printed simply because it contains facts that are of
interest, regardless of the way in which they are presented.
But never is a poorly written human interest
story printed; simply because the facts in it have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
little interest themselves and the story's usefulness
depends entirely upon the presentation of the facts.
Hence, the human interest story, more than any
other newspaper story, must be well written. And
yet there are no rules to assist in the writing of such
a story. In fact, its very nature depends upon originality
and newness in form and treatment.</p>

<p>In the first place, we cannot fall back upon the
conventional lead for a beginning, because a lead
would be out of place. As we have said before, the
human interest story does not begin with a lead for
the reason that it has no striking news content to
present in the lead. In many cases the whole story
depends upon cleverly arranged suspense; if the
content is given in a lead at the beginning suspense
is of course impossible. The human interest story
has no more need of a lead than does a short story&mdash;in
some ways a human interest story is very much
like a short story&mdash;and a short story that gives its
climax in the first paragraph would hardly be written
or read. But, just like the short story, a human
interest story must begin in an attractive way. In
the study of short story writing almost half of the
study is devoted to learning how to begin the story,
on the theory that the reader is some sort of a fugitive
animal that must be lassoed by an attractive and
interesting beginning. The theory is of course a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
true one and it holds good in the case of human
interest stories.</p>

<p>But no rules can be laid down to govern the beginning
of human interest or short stories. Each
story must begin in its own way&mdash;and each must
begin in a different way. Some writers of short
stories begin with dialogue, others with a clean-cut
witticism, others with attractive explanation or description,
others with a clever apology. The list is
endless. This endless list is ready for the reporter
who is trying to write human interest stories. But
the choosing must be his own. He must select the
beginning that seems best adapted to his story. As
an inspiration to reporters who are trying to write
human interest stories, a few beginnings clipped
from daily papers are given here. Some are good
and some are bad; the goodness or badness in each
case depends upon individual taste. They can
hardly be classified in more than a general way for
originality is opposed to all classifications. They
are merely suggestions.</p>

<p>A striking quotation or a bit of apt dialogue is
commonly used to attract attention to a story. Here
are some examples:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">"Burglars," whispered Mrs. Vermilye
to herself and she took another furtive
peek out of the windows of her rooms

<p class="noi">A well-written first sentence in a human interest

news story lead, and really tells only enough to make
you want to read further. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p class="noi">Some human interest stories begin, and effectively,
too, with a direct personal appeal to the reader;
thus:</p>

<p class="noi">A question is often used at the beginning of a human

<div class="block">

</div>

<p class="noi">Many of these stories, animal or otherwise, begin
with a name:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<div class="block">

</div>

<p>The beginning of a human interest story is always
the most important part; just like a news story, it
must attract attention with its first line. In the
same way, a good beginning is something more
than half done. But here the similarity between
the two ends. The news story, after the lead is
written, may slump in technique so that the end is
almost devoid of interest; the human interest story,
on the other hand, must keep up its standard of excellence
to the very last sentence and the last line
must have as much snap as the first. It is never
in danger of losing its last paragraph and so it
may be more rounded and complete; it must follow
a definite plan to the very end and then stop.
In this it is like the short story, although it seldom
has a plot. There are no rules to help us in writing
any part of the human interest story. Each attempt
has a different purpose and must be done in
a different way. Yet the reporter must know before
he begins just exactly how he is going to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
out the whole story. He must plan it as carefully
as a short story. A few minutes of careful thought
before he begins to write are better than much reworking
and alteration after the thing is done.
This applies to all newspaper writing.</p>

<p>Much of the effectiveness of the human interest
story depends upon the reporter's style. When we
try to write human interest stories we are no longer
interested in facts, as much as in words. Our readers
are not following us to be informed, but to be
entertained. And we can please them only by our
style and the fineness of our perception. Although
we have been told to write news stories in the common
every-day words of conversation, we are not
so limited in the human interest story. The elegance
of our style depends very largely upon the
size of our vocabulary, and elegance is not out of
place in this kind of story. Although we have been
told to use dialogue sparingly in news stories, our
human interest story may be composed entirely of
dialogue. In fact, we are hampered by no restrictions
except the restrictions of English grammar
and literary composition. Although we have sought
simplicity of expression before, we may now strive
for subtlety and for effect; we may write suggestively
and even obscurely. We are dealing with the
only part of the newspaper that makes any effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
toward literary excellence and only our originality
and cleverness can guide us.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to repeat that one cannot
write human interest stories in a cynical tone. They
are a reaction against cynicism. They require
one to feel keenly, as a human being, and
to write sympathetically, as a human being. The
reporter must see behind the facts and get the personal
side of the matter&mdash;and feel it. Then he must
tell the story just as he sees and feels it. Absolute
truthfulness in the telling is as necessary as keen
perception in the seeing. Humor must be sought
through the simple, truthful presentation of an
incongruous or humorous idea or situation; pathos
must be sought by the truthful presentation of a
pathetic picture. Just as soon as the reporter tries
to be funny or to be pathetic he fails, for the reader
is not looking to the reporter for fun or pathos&mdash;but
to the story that the reporter is telling. That
is, the story must be written objectively; the writer
must forget himself in his attempt to impress the
story upon his reader's mind. If the story itself
is fundamentally humorous or sad and the story is
clearly and truthfully told with all the details that
make it humorous or sad, it cannot help being effective.</p>

<p>The best way to learn how to write human interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
stories is to study human interest stories. Most
papers print them nowadays&mdash;they can easily be
distinguished by their lack of news value, and of
a lead&mdash;and the finest example is just as likely to
crop out in a little weekly as in a metropolitan daily.</p>

<p><b>4. The Animal Story.</b>&mdash;The examples printed earlier
in this chapter are specimens of the truest type
of human interest story because they deal with human
beings. They derive their joy or sorrow from
things that happen to men and women. But all the
sketches that are classed as human interest stories
are not so carefully confined to the limits of the
title. From the original human interest story the
type has grown until it includes many other things&mdash;almost
any piece of copy that has no intrinsic
news value. Every possible subject that may suit
itself to a pathetic or humorous treatment and thus
be interesting, although it has no news value, is
roughly classed as a human interest story.</p>

<p>One of these outgrowths of the true human interest
sketch is the animal story. In the large cities,
the "zoo" and the parks have become a fruitful
source of "news." Anything interesting that may
happen to the monkeys, or the elephant, the sparrows
or the squirrels in the parks, horses or dogs
in the street, is used as the excuse for a human interest
story. Sometimes the purpose is pathos and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
sometimes it is humor, but, whatever it may be, if
it is clever and interesting it gets its place in the
paper, a place entirely out of proportion to its true
news value. The results sometimes verge very close
upon nature faking, but after all they are only the
result of the "up-lift" idea of looking at all life in
a more sympathetic way. Several of the beginnings
quoted earlier in this chapter belong to animal
stories and the following is a complete one:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Smithy Kain was only a mongrel,
horsemen will say, but in his equine
heart there coursed the blood of thoroughbreds.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Smithy Kain was killed yesterday afternoon,
shot through the head, while
thousands of Wisconsin fair patrons
looked on in shuddering sympathy.</p>

<p class="nt nb">It was a tragedy of the track.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Owners, trainers and drivers always
are quick to declare that no greater
courage is known than that possessed
and demonstrated by race horses in
hard-fought battles on the turf, and the
truth of this was never more strikingly
brought home than in the death of
Smithy Kain yesterday.</p>

<p class="nt nb">With a left hind foot snapped at the
fetlock, Smithy Kain raced around the
track, his valiant spirit and unfaltering
gameness keeping him up until he had
completed the course in unwavering pursuit
of the flying horses in front. Every
jump meant intense agony, but he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
not quit. Not until near the finish did
his strength give out, and not until then
was the pitiable truth discovered. Men
used to exhibitions of gameness in tests
that try the soul looked on in mute admiration
as Smithy Kain shivered and
stumbled from the pain that rapidly
sapped his life. Women cried openly.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Two shots from the pistol of a park
policeman ended the life and sufferings
of the horse that was only a mongrel,
but who, in his equine way, was a
thoroughbred of thoroughbreds.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Smithy Kain gave to his master the
best that his animal mind and soul possessed.
No better memorial can be
written even of man himself.</p>
</div>

<p><b>5. The Special Feature Story.</b>&mdash;One step beyond
the animal story is the special feature story. This
kind of story is classed with the human interest
story because it has no news value and because its
only purpose is to entertain or to inform in a general
way; and yet it rarely contains any human interest.
There is no space in this book for a complete
discussion of the special feature story&mdash;an entire
volume might be devoted to the subject&mdash;but
this form of story is often seen in the news columns
of the daily papers and deserves a mention here.
Ordinarily the special feature story is not written
by reporters, although there is no reason why reporters
should not use in this way many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
facts that come to them. The story usually comes
from outside the newspaper office, from a contributor,
from a syndicate, or from some other daily,
weekly, or monthly publication; however a word or
two here may suggest to the reporter the possibility
of adding to his usefulness by writing such stories
for his paper.</p>

<p>The special feature story may be almost anything.
The name is used to designate timely magazine articles,
timely write-ups for the Sunday edition, and
timely squibs for the columns of the daily papers.
The last use is the one that interests us and it interests
us because it is very closely related to the human
interest story. The editors usually call it a feature
story because it is worth printing in spite of the
fact that it has no news value. In this and in its
timeliness it is like the human interest story. But
it is not written for humor or pathos; its purpose
is to entertain the reader. Its method is largely
expository and its style may be anything; it may explain
or it may simply comment in a witty way. The
utilizing of otherwise useless by-products of the
news is its purpose&mdash;in this it is very much like the
animal story.</p>

<p>Subjects for feature stories may come from anywhere
and may be almost anything. A very common
kind of feature story is the weather story that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
many newspapers print every day. The weather is
taken as the excuse for two or three stickfuls of
print which explain and comment upon weather conditions,
past, present and future. Growing out of
this, there is the season story which deals with any
subject that the season may suggest: the closing of
Coney Island, the spring styles in men's hats, the
first fur overcoat, Commencement presents, Easter
eggs&mdash;anything in season. Further removed from
the human interest story is the timely write-up
which has no other purpose than to explain, in a
more or less serious or sensible way, any interesting
subject that comes to hand. The story purports
not only to entertain but to inform as well. It has
no news value and yet it is usually timely. Here are
a few subjects selected at random from the daily
papers: "He'll pay no tax on cake," explaining in
a humorous way the customs methods that held up
the importation of an Italian Christmas cake;
"Clearing House for Brains," a description of the
new employment bureau of the Princeton Club of
New York; "Ideal man picked by the Barnard
girl," a humorous resum&eacute; of some Barnard College
class statistics; "Winning a Varsity Letter," telling
what a varsity letter stands for, how it is won, and
what the customs of the various colleges in regard
to letters are; "Jerry Moore raises a record corn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
crop," telling how a fifteen-year-old boy won prizes
with a little patch of corn.</p>

<p>These are just a few suggestions to open up to
the reporter the vast field for special feature articles.
To be sure, many of them are submitted by outsiders,
but there is no reason why a reporter should
not write these stories as well as human interest
stories for his paper, since he is in the best position
to get the material. Whenever a special feature
story becomes too large for the daily edition
there is always a possibility of selling it to the Sunday
section or to a monthly magazine. The writing
of special feature stories is directly in line with the
reporter's work, because the ordinary method of
gathering facts for a feature article and arranging
them in an interesting, newsy way follows closely
the method by which a reporter covers and writes
a news story. Hence almost without exception the
most successful magazine feature writers are, or
have been, newspaper reporters.</p>

<a name="xvi" id="xvi"></a>XVI<br />
<br />
<small>DRAMATIC REPORTING</small></h2>


<p>Dramatic reporting is one of the most misused
of the newspaper reporter's activities. To many
reporters, as well as to their editors, it is just an
easy way of getting free admission to the theater
in return for a half column of copy. Hence it is
treated in an unjustly trivial way; the reports of
theatrical productions are printed most often as
space fillers or as a small advertisement in return for
free tickets. But after all the work is an important
one and should be done only by skillful and expert
hands. Dramatic reporting is included in this book,
not because it is thought possible to give the subject
an adequate treatment, but because theatrical
reporting is a branch of the newspaper trade that
may fall to the hands of the youngest reporter. In
mere justice to the stage the reporter who writes
up a play should know something about the real significance
of what he is doing. It is much easier
to tell the beginner what not to do than to tell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
exactly what to do. The faults in dramatic reporting
are far more evident than the virtues; and yet
there are some positive things that may be said on
the subject.</p>

<p>The first important question in the whole matter
is "Who does dramatic reporting?" One would like
to answer, "Skilled critics of broad knowledge and
experience." But unfortunately almost anybody
does it&mdash;any one about the office who is willing to
give up his evening to go to the theater. To be sure,
many metropolitan papers employ skilled critics to
write their dramatic copy and run the theatrical
news over the critic's name. Some editors of
smaller papers have the decency to do the work
themselves. But in most cases the work is given
to an ordinary reporter&mdash;and not infrequently to the
greenest reporter on the staff. Worse than that, the
work is seldom given to the same reporter continuously,
but is passed around among all the members
of the staff. Even a green cub may learn by experience
how to report plays, but if the work falls to
him only once a month his training is very
meager. It would seem in these days of much discussion
of the theater that editors would realize
the power which they have over the stage through
their favorable or unfavorable criticism. But they
do not, perhaps because they know little about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
stage, and the appeal must be made to their reporters.
Every reporter, except upon the largest
papers, has the opportunity sooner or later to give
his opinion on a play. In anticipation of that opportunity
these few words of advice are offered.</p>

<p>The first requisite in dramatic criticism is a background
of knowledge of the drama and the stage.
To children, and to some grown people, too, the
stage is a little dream world of absolute realities.
Their imaginations turn the picture that is placed before
them into real, throbbing life. They do not
see the unreality of the art, the suggestive effects,
the flimsy delusions; to them the play is real life, the
stage is a real drawing room or a real wood, and
they cannot conceive of the actors existing outside
their parts. But the critic must look deeper; he
must understand the machinery that produces the
effects and he must weigh the success of the effects.
He must get behind the play and see the actors outside
the cast and the stage without its scenery;
the dramatic art must be to him a highly technical
profession. For this reason, he must know something
about dramatic technique; he must have some
background of knowledge. He must study the theater
from every point of view, from an orchestra
seat, from behind the scenes, from a peekhole in
the playwright's study, and from the pages of stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
history. All the tricks and effects must be evident
to him. The only thing that will teach him this is
constant, intelligent theater-going. He must be
familiar with all of the plays of the season and
with all of the prominent plays of all seasons. A
child cannot criticize the first play that he sees because
he has nothing with which to compare it. In
the same way a reporter cannot justly judge any
kind of play until he has seen another of the same
kind with which to compare it. Hence he must
know many plays and must know something about
the history of the theater. Dramatic criticism is
relative and the critic must have a basis for his comparison.</p>

<p>This background of knowledge may seem a difficult
thing to acquire. It is; and it can best be acquired
by watching many plays with an eye for the
technique of the art. The critic may judge a play
from its effect upon him, but his judgment will be
superficial. He must try to see what the playwright
is trying to do, how well he succeeds, what tricks he
employs. He must judge the work of the stage carpenter
and of the costumer. He must try to realize
what problem the leading lady has to face and how
well she solves it. The same carefulness of judgment
must be given to each member of the cast.
Only when the critic is able to see past the footlights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and to understand the technique of the art,
can he judge intelligently. And as his judgment
can be at best only relative, he must have a background
of many plays and much stage knowledge
upon which to base his estimate of any one production.</p>

<p>The ideal criticism, based upon this background
of knowledge, would be absolutely fair and unprejudiced.
But unfortunately this ideal cannot always
be followed. Much dramatic criticism is colored by
the policy of the paper that prints it. Very few
critics are so fortunate as to be able to say exactly
what they think about a play; they must say what
the editor wants them to say. Some theatrical copy,
especially write-ups of vaudeville shows, is paid for
and must contain nothing but praise. Sometimes it
is necessary to praise the poorest production simply
because the paper is receiving so much a column
for the praise. In many other cases, when the copy
is not paid for, the editor often considers it only
fair to give the production a little puff in return
for the free press tickets. And so a large share
of any reporter's dramatic criticism is reduced to
selecting things that he can praise. Yet, one cannot
praise in a way that is too evident; he cannot simply
say "The play was good; the staging was good; the
acting was good; in fact, everything was good."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
He must praise more cleverly and give his copy
the appearance of honest criticism. Perhaps the
principle is wrong, but nevertheless it exists and
happy is the dramatic critic whose paper allows him
to say exactly what he thinks. However, whether
one may say what he thinks or must say what his
editor wants him to say, he must have as his background
a thorough knowledge of the stage upon
which he may base a comparison or a contrast and
with which he may make intelligent statements.
The following illustrates what may be done with a
paid report of a mediocre vaudeville show in which
every act must be praised&mdash;the report was written
on Monday of a week's run and is intended to induce
people to see the show:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">This week's bill at &mdash;&mdash; Vaudeville
Theatre is dashed onto the boards by a
very exciting act, "The Flying Martins,"
whose thrilling tricks put the audience
in a proper state of mind for the sparkling
and laughable program that follows&mdash;a
state of mind that keeps its high
pitch without a break or let-down to the
very end of Dr. Herman's side-splitting
electrical pranks. This man, who has
truly "tamed electricity," does many remarkable
things with his big coils and
high voltage currents and plays many
extremely funny tricks upon his row of
"unsuspecting-handsome" young volunteers.</p>

<p class="nt nb"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
The musical little playlet, "The Barn
Dance," is very jokingly carried off by
its Jack-of-all-Trades, "Zeke," the constable,
and its pretty little ensemble song,
"I'll Build a Nest for You." Many a
young husband can get pointers on
"home rule" from "Baseballitis;" it is a
mighty good presentation of the "My
Hero" theme in actual life. Hilda Hawthorne
gives us some high-class ventriloquism
with a good puppet song that is
truly wonderful. There's a lot of good
music, very good music in the sketch
executed by "The Three Vagrants," as
well as a lot of fun; one can hardly
realize what an amount of melody an
old accordion contains. Audrey Pringle
and George Whiting have a hit that
is sparkling with quick changes from
Irish love songs to bull frog croaking
with Italian variations.</p>
</div>

<p>For the purpose of a more complete study of
the subject, however, we shall consider only dramatic
criticism that is not restricted by editorial
dictum or by the requirements of paid-space. That
is, we shall imagine that we can praise or condemn
or say anything we please concerning the dramatic
production which we are to report. When we look
at the subject in this way there are some positive
things that may be said about theatrical reporting,
but there are many more negative rules, that may
be reduced to mere "Don'ts." The same principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
hold good in dramatic criticism that is hampered
by policy, but to a less degree.</p>

<p>In the first place, the one thing that a dramatic
reporter must have when he begins to write his
copy after the performance is some positive idea
about the play, some definite criticism, upon which
to base his whole report. It is impossible to write
a coherent report from chance jottings and to confine
the report to saying "This was good; that was
bad, the other was mediocre." The critic must
have a positive central idea upon which to hang his
criticism. This central idea plays the same part
in his report as the feature in a news story&mdash;it is
the feature of his report which he brings into the
first sentence, to which he attaches every item, and
with which he ends his report. To secure this idea,
the reporter must watch the play closely with the
purpose of crystallizing his judgment in a single
conception, thought, or impression. Sometimes this
impression comes as an inspiration, sometimes it is
the result of hard thought during or after the play.
It may be concerned with the theme of the play,
the playwright's work, the lines, the staging, the
effects, the tricks, the acting as a whole, the acting
of single persons, the music, the dancing, the costumes&mdash;anything
connected with the production&mdash;but
the idea must be big enough to carry the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
report and to be the gist of what the critic has to
say about the play. It must be his complete, concise
opinion of the performance.</p>

<p>When, as the critic watches the play, some idea
comes to him for his report he should jot it down.
As the play progresses he should develop this idea
and watch for details that carry it out. There is
no reason to be ashamed of taking notes in the
theater and the notes will prove very useful at the
office afterward. Perhaps after the play is over
the critic finds that his jottings contain another
idea that is of greater importance than the first;
then he may incorporate the second into the first or
discard the first altogether. Even after one has
crystallized his judgment into a concise opinion he
must elaborate and illustrate it and the program of
the play is always of value in enabling one to refer
definitely to the individual actors, characters, and
other persons, by name. But, however complete the
final judgment and the notes may be, it is always
well to write the report immediately. When one
leaves the theater his mind is teeming with things to
say about the play, thousands of them, but after a
night's sleep it is doubtful if a single full-grown
idea will remain and the jottings will be absolutely
lifeless and unsuggestive.</p>

<p>This is the positive instruction that may be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to young dramatic critics. It is so important and
is unknown to so many young theatrical reporters,
that it may be well to sum it up again. A dramatic
criticism must be coherent; it must be unified. It
must be the embodiment of a single idea about the
play and every detail in the report must be attached
to that idea. It is not sufficient to state the idea
in a clever way; it must be expanded and elaborated
with examples and reasons and must show careful
thought. It is well to outline the report before it
is written and to arrange a logical sequence of
thought so that the result may be well-rounded and
coherent.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a dramatic criticism
in which this course is followed. It neither
praises nor condemns but it points out gently
wherein the play is strong or weak&mdash;and every sentence
is attached to one central idea:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="c nt nb">A POLITE LITTLE PLAY.</p>

<p class="nt nb s">Never raise your voice, my dear Gerald. That is the
only thing left to distinguish us from the lower classes.
<em>Lord Wynlea in "The Best People".</em></p>

<p class="nt nb">The new comedy at the Lyric Theatre
is written in accordance with Lord
Wynlea's dictum quoted above. It is
mannerly, well poised, ingratiating and
deft. As a minor effort in the high
comedy style it is welcome, because it
affords a respite from the "plays with
a punch" and the prevalent boisterous
specimens of the work of yeomen who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
go at the art of dramatic writing with
main strength.</p>

<p class="nt nb">"The Best People" is by Frederick
Lonsdale and Frank Curzen, who manifestly
know some of them. It was done
at Wyndham's Theatre in London, and
we think that in a comfortable English
playhouse, with tea between acts and
leisurely persons with whom to visit in
the foyer, it would make an agreeable
matinee. Certainly it is admirably acted
here, and, as has been intimated, its
quiet drollery and its polite maneuvering
make it a relief.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Whether American audiences, used to
stronger fare than tea at the theatre,
will find it sustaining is a question that
would seem to be answered by the announcement,
just received from the
Lyric, that the engagement closes next
Saturday evening.</p>

<p class="nt nb">The fable relates how the Honorable
Mrs. Bayle discovered that her husband
and Lady Ensworth had been flirting
with peril during her absence in Egypt,
how she blithely threw them much together,
with the result that they grew
intensely weary of each other, and how
at last everybody concerned was happily
and sensibly reconciled.</p>

<p class="nt nb">The spirit of the piece is sane and
"nice," the decoration of it whimsical
and graceful.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Miss Lucille Watson, embodying the
spirit of witty mischief, gives a very
fine performance of the part of Mrs.
Bayle, a "smart," good woman, and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Ruth Shepley is excellent in byplay and
flutter as a silly, good woman.</p>

<p class="nt nb">Cyril Scott is graceful and vigorous
as a philandering husband, Dallas Anderson
comical as a London clubman
with a keener relish in life than he is
willing to betray, and William McVey
wise, paternal and weighty in that kind
of a part.</p>

<p class="nt nb">"The Best People" is a pleasant spring
fillip.</p>
</div>

<p>The first admonition in theatrical reporting is
"Don't resum&eacute; the plot or tell the story of the
play." This is almost all that many dramatic reporters
try to do, because it is the easiest thing to
do and requires the least thought. But, after all, it
is usually valueless. The story of the play does
not interest readers who have already seen the play
and it spoils the enjoyment of the play for those
who intend to see it. The usual purpose of any
theatrical report is to criticize, but a report that
simply resum&eacute;s the story of the play is not a criticism;
hence space devoted to the story is usually
wasted. To be sure, this admonition must be qualified.
If the development of the critic's judgment of
the play requires a resum&eacute; of the story, there is then
a reason for outlining the action. However, even
then, the outline should be very brief.</p>

<p>The following is a typical example of the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
dramatic reporting which is satisfied when it has
told the story of the play. In this, the first two
sentences are a very bald attempt to repay the manager
for his tickets. The resum&eacute; of the story, given
very obviously to fill space, is not of any critical
value. The only real criticism is at the end and
is inadequate because the praise is given without
reason.</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nt nb">Grace George and her small but excellent
company of artists added one
more to their long list of successful
performances last night in the production
of Geraldine Bonner's clever comedy
of modern life, "Sauce for the
Goose," at the &mdash;&mdash; Theatre. That the
moody and sparkling Miss George has
a good claim to the title of America's
leading comedienne, no one who saw
the performance last evening could
deny. In this piece she is cast for the
part of Kitty Constable, who is in the
third year of her married life and living
with her husband in New York City.
Mr. Constable has been engaged in
writing a book on the emancipation of
woman and as a result has come to neglect
his pretty little wife and seek the
companionship of a certain woman of
great intellect, Mrs. Alloway, who leads
him on by an affected sympathy with
his work. He chides his wife for her
seeming negligence of the culture of her
mind, telling her that she lacks grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
matter. The climax comes when Mr.
Constable tries to get away from his
wife on the evening of their wedding
anniversary to dine with Mrs. Alloway.
Kitty tries the emancipated woman idea
and goes to the opera with another man
and has dinner with him in his apartments.
She lets her husband know of
her plans and he comes to the room
in a rage. By thus playing first on his
jealousy and then by ridiculing his
ideas, she wins him back to herself. The
company was made up of artists and
there was not a crude spot in the whole
performance. The part of Harry Travers,
the friend of Mrs. Constable's, was
excellently done by Frederick Perry, as
was that of Mr. Constable by Herbert
Percy. Probably the most difficult character
in the play to portray was that of
the "woman's rights" woman, Mrs. Alloway,
which was most admirably done
by Edith Wakeman.</p>
</div>

<p>The word criticism must not lead the reporter to
think that, as a critic, his only function is to find
fault. To criticize may mean to praise as well as
to condemn. If the critic is not restricted by the
policy of his paper, he should be as willing to
praise as to condemn, and vice versa. But whichever
course he takes he must be ready to defend his
criticism and to tell why he praises or why he condemns.
There is always a tendency to praise a play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
in return for the free tickets; this should be put
aside absolutely. The critic owes something to the
public as well as to the manager. If the play seems
to him to be bad, he must say so without hesitation
and he must tell why it is bad. Too many really
bad plays are immensely advertised by a critic's undefended
statement that they are not fit to be seen.
Had the critic given definite reasons for his condemnation,
his criticism might have accomplished
its purpose. In the same way it is useless to say
simply that a play is good. Its good points must
be enumerated and the reader must be told why it
is good.</p>

<p>However, criticism must be written with delicacy.
If your heart tells you to praise, praise; if your
heart tells you to condemn, condemn with care.
Remember that your condemnation may put the
play off the boards or at least hurt its success, and
there must be sufficient reason for such radical action.
The critic's debt to the public is large, but
he owes some consideration to the manager. He
must hesitate before he says anything that may ruin
the manager's business. Critics very often condemn
a play for trivial reasons; they feel indisposed, perhaps
because their dinner has not agreed with them,
the play does not fit into their mood and they turn
in a half column of ruinous condemnation. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
they like a certain kind of production&mdash;farces, for
instance&mdash;and systematically vent their ire on every
tragedy and every musical comedy. They do not
use perspective; they do not judge the stage as
a whole. No matter how poor a play is or how
much a critic dislikes it, he must consider what
the stage people are trying to do and judge accordingly.
In many cases it is not the individual play
that deserves adverse criticism, but the kind of play.
All of these things must be considered; every dramatic
critic must have perspective. He must be fair
to the stage people and to the public; his influence is
greater than he may imagine.</p>

<p>No matter how strong the occasion for condemnation
may be, the dramatic critic is never justified
in speaking bitterly. The poor production is not
a personal offense against him nor against the public.
It is simply a bad or an unworthy attempt and
his duty is confined to pointing how or why it is
not worthy. That does not mean that he is justified
in using bitter, abusive, or even sarcastic language.
It is great sport to make fun of things and
to exercise one's wits at some one's else expense&mdash;it
is also easy&mdash;but that is not dramatic criticism.
The public asks the critic to tell them calmly and
fairly, even coldly, the reasons for or against a production&mdash;the
reasons why they should, or should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
not, spend their money to see it&mdash;bitter sarcasm
overreaches the mark. Just as soon as a critic
tries to be personal in his remarks on a play he
is exceeding his prerogative and is open to serious
criticism himself.</p>

<p>The necessary attributes of a dramatic reporter,
as we have seen, are: fairness, logical thinking, and
a background of stage knowledge. And of these
three, the background is of the greatest importance;
it is the stimulus and the check for the other two.
The more a critic can know about every phase of the
theatrical profession, contemporary or historical, the
better will be his criticisms. The more knowledge
of the stage that his copy shows, the more greedily
will his readers look for his "Theatrical News"
each day. However clear his idea of a play may
be he cannot express it clearly and readably without
a background of other plays to refer to. And,
by the same sign, a wealth of allusions and a quantity
of theatrical lore will often carry a critic past
many a play concerning which he is unable to form
a clear opinion. To develop your ability as a dramatic
reporter, watch the theatrical criticisms in
reputable dailies and weeklies and learn from them.</p>

Great Northwest," "Our Interests."</p>

Her Atonement Company.</p>

<p class="hang">Do not quote the names of characters in plays, as

<p><b>9. Compounds and Divisions:</b></p>

<p class="hang">Omit the hyphen when using an adverb compounded
with -ly before a participle: a newly built house.</p>

<p class="hang">Use a hyphen after prefixes ending in a vowel (except
bi and tri) when using them before a vowel:
co-exist. When using such a prefix before a consonant
do not use the hyphen except to distinguish
the word from a word of the same letters
but of different meaning: correspondent, but
co-respondent (one called to answer a summons);
recreation, but re-create (to create anew) reform,
but re-form (to form again); re-enforced;
biennial, etc.</p>

<p class="hang">Do not use the hyphen in the names of rooms when
the prefix is of only one syllable: bedroom, courtroom,
bathroom, etc. (except blue room, green
room, etc.).<br />
<br />
When the prefix is of more than one syllable
use the hyphen. Follow the same rule in making
compounds of house, shop, yard, maker, holder,
keeper, builder, worker: shipbuilder, doorkeeper.</p>

<p class="hang">In dividing at the end of a line:<br />

Do not run over a syllable of two letters.<br />

Do not divide a word of five letters or less.<br />
</p>

<p><b>10. Figures:</b></p>

is intended: twenty-three, 123, about a thousand,
a dollar, a million, millions, a thousand to one,
from four to five hundred.</p>

<p class="hang">Use figures for numbers of less than 100 when
they are used in connection with larger numbers:

numerals and the verses in figures: Matt. xxii.
37-40; I. John v. 1-15. In Sunday school lessons

<h2><a name="ai" id="ai"></a>APPENDIX I<br />
<br />
<small>SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY</small></h2>

<p>These Suggestions for Study embody the method
used in the course in News Story Writing in the
Course in Journalism of the University of Wisconsin.
The text of the several chapters corresponds
to the lectures that are given in preparation for, and
in connection with, the study of the various kinds
of news stories. These Suggestions for Study correspond
to the exercises by which the students learn
the application of the principles embodied in the
lectures. Hence these suggestions are given mainly
from the instructor's point of view; however, a
slight alteration will adapt them to home or individual
study. Although they give very little practice
in news gathering, they enable the student to
gain practice in the writing of news&mdash;in accordance
with the purpose of this book. The reporter who
is studying the business in a newspaper office may
use them to advantage in connection with his regular
work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>


<p class="c">EXERCISES FOR THE FIRST CHAPTER</p>

<ol>
<li>Collect clippings of representative news stories,
printed in the daily papers, to be used as
models.</li>

<li>Keep a book of tips of expected news in your
town or city.</li>

<li>Study news stories in your local paper and try
to determine from what source the original
news tip came. Try to discover from the story
the routine of news gathering which furnished
the facts.</li>

<li>In the same stories try to determine what persons
were interviewed; frame the questions that
the reporter might have asked to secure the
facts. The instructor may impersonate various
persons in a given news story and have the
students interview him for the facts; this is
to assist the student in learning to keep the
point of view and to keep him from asking
ridiculous questions.</li>

<li>Try to discover what stories in any newspaper
are the result of actual reporting by staff reporters&mdash;point
out where the others come from.</li>

<li>Notice the date line on stories that come from
the outside, and learn its form.</li>
</ol>


<p class="c">EXERCISES FOR THE SECOND CHAPTER</p>

<ol>
<li>Watch for local stories that seem to be worth
sending out; determine what element in them
makes them worth sending out; calculate how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
far from their source they would be worth
printing.</li>

<li>Study the news value of stories that are printed
in the local papers; determine why they were
printed. Look for the same things in stories
with date lines in the local papers.</li>

<li>Determine what class of readers any given news
story would interest.</li>

<li>Notice the time element (timeliness) in newspaper
stories.</li>

<li>Try to determine the radius of your local paper's
personal news sources: how near the
printing office one must live to be worth personal
mention.</li>

<li>Watch for local stories whose news value depends
upon the death element, upon a prominent
name, a significant loss of property, mere
unusualness, human interest, or personal appeal;
see what the local papers do with these
stories and whether the local correspondents
send them out.</li>

<li>Analyze the nature of the personal appeal in
stories that are printed only for their personal
appeal.</li>

<li>Notice how local reasons change the news values
of local stories.</li>

<li>In any or all of these stories determine what
the feature is. Distinguish between the fundamental
incident which the story reports and the
additional significant feature which enhances
the news value of the fundamental incident.</li>
</ol>


<p class="c"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
EXERCISES FOR THE THIRD CHAPTER</p>

<ol>
<li>Run over the Style Book at the end of this
book; note the essential points in newspaper
style.</li>

<li>Give the principal rules for the preparation of
copy.</li>

<li>Glance over the "Don'ts" in the Style Book.</li>
</ol>

<p class="c">EXERCISES FOR THE FOURTH CHAPTER</p>

<ol>
<li>Study the form and construction of news stories,
especially simple fire stories.</li>

<li>Pick out the feature of each story&mdash;the additional
incident in the story which increases the
news value of the story itself&mdash;and see if the
striking feature has been played up to best advantage.</li>

<li>Notice how the reader's customary questions&mdash;what,
where, when, who, how, and why&mdash;are
answered in the lead. Make a list of the answers
in any given story.</li>
</ol>

<p class="c">EXERCISES FOR THE FIFTH CHAPTER</p>

<ol>
<li>Collect good fire stories appearing in the newspapers.
Study the construction of the lead
and the order in which the facts are presented
in the body of each story.</li>

<li>Write the leads of fire stories. The chances
are that actual fires will seldom occur at the
time when the student wishes to study the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
writing of fire stories, but the instructor may
give his class, orally or in writing, the facts
of a fire story. He may use imaginary facts
or he may take the facts from a story clipped
from a newspaper&mdash;the latter method is better
because it enables the instructor to show the
students, after they have written their stories,
just how the original story was written in the
newspaper office. The facts should be given
in the order in which a reporter would probably
secure them in actual reporting so that
the student may learn to sort and arrange the
facts that he wishes to use, and to select the
feature. The instructor may even impersonate
different persons connected with the story
and have the class interview him for the facts.
This method is to be followed throughout the
whole study of news story writing. (In individual
study, practice may be secured from
writing up imaginary or real facts.)</li>

<li>In these first fire stories, use fires that have no
interest beyond the interest in the fire itself&mdash;that
is, no feature. Begin the story with "Fire"
and devote the lead to answering the reader's
customary questions.</li>

<li>Look for newspaper fire stories that are not
correctly written and reconstruct the lead according
to the logic of the fire lead. That is,
strive for conciseness and cut out details that
do not properly belong in the lead.</li>

<li>Make a list of the reader's customary questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
concerning any fire and write out the briefest
possible answers. Then construct a lead to
embody these answers. Determine which answer
should come first and which last, according
to importance.</li>

<li>Write the bodies of some of these stories. First
list the facts that are to be presented and determine
the order of their importance.</li>

<li>Emphasize the separateness and completeness
of the two parts of the story&mdash;the lead and the
body of the story. Test the leads to see if
they would be clear in themselves without further
explanation.</li>

<li>Strive for brevity, conciseness and clearness;
wage war on all attempts at fine writing.</li>
</ol>

<p class="c">EXERCISES FOR THE SIXTH CHAPTER</p>

<ol>
<li>Study fire stories which have features&mdash;an interest
beyond the mere fire itself&mdash;and see how
the newspapers write them.</li>

<li>In a feature fire story of Class I., make a list
of the reader's customary questions concerning
the fire, as if it were a simple fire story,
and a list of the answers. See if any answer
is more interesting than the fire itself, or if
its presence makes the story more interesting.
Show that such an answer is the feature.</li>

<li>Write fire stories with features in some one
of the reader's customary answers. (Class I.)</li>

<li>Study a simple fire story and try to imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
what things&mdash;properly answers to the reader's
customary questions&mdash;might happen to give the
fire greater news value. This will show the student
how to look for the feature of a story.</li>

<li>Write the lead of any fire story in as many
different ways as possible, striving in each one
to play up the same feature.</li>

<li>Study a simple fire story and try to imagine
what unexpected things might occur in connection
with the fire which would be of greater
interest than the fire itself. Show that these
would be features and that they do not fall
within the answers to the reader's customary
questions&mdash;i. e., they are unexpected.</li>

<li>Write fire stories with features in unexpected
attendant circumstances.</li>

<li>Make up lists of dead and injured; notice how
the newspapers arrange and punctuate these
lists.</li>

<li>Study fire stories with more than one feature.
Work out the possibilities in any given fire
along these lines.</li>

<li>Write fire stories in which there is more than
one feature worth a place in the lead. Try
various combinations in the lead to discover
the happiest arrangement. Show how one of
many striking features may be of so much
importance as to drive the other features entirely
out of the lead.</li>
</ol>

<p class="c"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
EXERCISES FOR THE SEVENTH CHAPTER</p>

<ol>
<li>Count the number of words in the sentences
and paragraphs of representative newspaper
stories.</li>

<li>Practice writing fire leads that might be printed
alone without the rest of the story.</li>

<li>Take a fire lead and experiment with various
beginnings to show the possibilities:
<ul>
<li class="li2">a. Noun&mdash;experiment with and without articles.</li>
<li class="li2">b. Infinitive&mdash;Distinguish infinitives in "to"
and in "-ing."</li>
<li class="li2">c. <em>That</em> clause.</li>
<li class="li2">d. Prepositional phrase.</li>
<li class="li2">e. Temporal clause.</li>
<li class="li2">f. Causal clause.</li>
<li class="li2">g. Others.</li>
</ul>
Show that any of these beginnings may be
used in the playing up of any one feature.
</li>

<li>Study how a name may overshadow an interesting
story; determine when a name is worth
first place in a lead. Study the practice of representative
papers in this&mdash;do not hesitate to
show how a paper has been illogical in beginning
certain stories with an unknown name,
for everything one sees in a newspaper is not
ipso facto good usage in newspaper writing.</li>

<li>In students' stories, notice what the principal
verb says and point out any misplaced emphasis.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Wage war on "was the unusual experience of"
and "was the fate of" in leads.</li>

<li>Try to avoid "broke out" in fire leads. Devote
the space to more interesting action.</li>

<li>Cut out all useless words in students' exercises;
strive for brevity. Go through a student's
story and weigh the value of each word, phrase,
and sentence; cut out the useless ones or try
to express them more briefly. Do the same to
actual newspaper stories.</li>

<li>Weigh the value of every detail introduced
into a lead and cut out the unnecessary ones;
relegate them to the rest of the story.</li>

<li>Wage war on all meaningless generalities; demand
exactness.</li>

<li>Refer the class to the Style Book in this volume
and require them to follow a uniform
style. Point out the differences in style of
various papers.</li>

<li>See if the bodies of students' stories mean anything
without the presence of the leads. Require
the body of the story to be separate and
complete in itself. This need not, of course,
be carried to the point of repeating addresses
given in the lead.</li>

<li>Try writing a story by simply elaborating and
explaining the details mentioned in the lead of

added.</li>

paragraph. Determine how many paragraphs
it can lose without sacrificing its interest.</li>

<li>In writing the body of a fire story, list the facts
that are to be told, in their logical order; thus:

beginning.</li>

<li>Practice getting the facts of a story by means
of interviews. The instructor may have the

<small>NEWS STORIES TO BE CORRECTED</small></h2>

<p>(The following stories have been prepared
to illustrate some of the most usual
mistakes in newspaper writing. They
may be rewritten or used as exercises in
copy-reading. As a class exercise, the student

<em>without recopying</em>, just as a copy-reader

<div class="block3">

<p class="c nt nb lh"><big>I</big></p>

<p class="lh">Shortly after 2:30 this morning fire

broke out in a pile of old papers in the

basement of the Harmony Flat building,

at 1356 Congress avenue, a four-story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
eight-apartment structure. Two firemen

were killed by a falling wall.</p>


<p class="lh"><span style="line-height: 4em;">The fire had a good start before the

janitor, Michael Jones, who sleeps in the

basement, awoke. He turned in an alarm

and ran through the halls awakening the

occupants. The people on the two lower

floors escaped in their night clothing by

the stairways, but the fire spread very rapidly,

the occupants of the upper floors being

forced to flee down the fire escapes in

the rear.</span></p>


<p class="lh">When the firemen put in an appearance,

Mrs. Jeanette Huyler appeared at a third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
story window and called for help. An extension

ladder being hoisted, she was rescued

without difficulty. During the fire

the wall on the east side fell and killed

Fireman John Casey and Jacob Hughes;

Fireman Williams Jacobs was hit on the

head by a brick and seriously injured.</p>


<p class="lh">The fire was extinguished before it

spread to an adjoining three-story flat

building on the west.</p>


<p class="lh">The firemen in searching the ruins

found the body of a man who was later

identified as Rupert Smithers; he was 70

and occupied a lower flat by himself. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
janitor said that he was deaf and probably

did not hear the warning. The three

dead and injured firemen belong to Hose

Co. No.&nbsp;24.</p>


<p class="lh">Loss $50,000, fully insured.</p>


<hr class="hr6" />


<p class="c nt nb lh"><big>II</big></p>

<p class="lh">The police have arrested John Johnson,

23 years old, 2367 Sixth Street, charged

with murdering Mrs. Laura Buckthorn,

the well-known proprietor of the Duchess

Restaurant, 438 High street. He is now

in the county jail.</p>


<p class="lh">Mrs. Buckthorn was sixty years old and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the widow of one of the oldest settlers in

the city.</p>


<p class="lh">She lived in her small cottage at 2367

Sixth Street and supported herself by

means of the restaurant. John Johnson, a

street car motorman occupied a room in

her cottage. Mrs. Buckthorn was found

dead in her bed, in a pool of blood, with

two bullet holes in her head this morning.

Mrs. Grady, the restaurant cook said, "I

became alarmed when Mrs. Buckthorn did

not appear as usual at the restaurant this

morning and went to her home to find

her."</p>


<p class="lh">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Inquiry showed that Mrs. Buckthorn

had drawn $250 from the First National

Bank yesterday and her daughter, Mrs.

J. D. Jackson, 1548 Sixth Street, says that

her mother often kept such sums of money

at home under the mattress of her bed.

Mrs. Jackson also says that she often

warned her mother against such habits.

The money was not under the mattress

this morning.</p>


<p class="lh">Further inquiry showed that John Johnson

did not appear for work as usual this

morning and was later found by Policeman

Patrick O'Hara in the railroad yards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>

He had with him $223.67 and a ticket to

New York. He was known to be hard up

but refused to account for the money and

was given a berth in the county jail.</p>


<p class="lh">Samuel Benson, cashier of the First National,

is sure that the two 100-dollar

bills which were found on Johnson are the

same bills that he gave to Mrs. Buckthorn

yesterday afternoon. Johnson will be

given a hearing to-morrow but it is already

considered certain that he is the

guilty party, the evidence being so strong.</p>

<big>III</big></p>

<p class="lh">Sparks, resulting from the grounding

of an electric wire, ignited a bucket of gasolene

and fired the shop of the G. W.

Smith Motor Co., at 228, 232 West street

last night, five automobiles valued at

$5,800 being destroyed and the building

being damaged to the extent of 6,200 dollars

by fire.</p>


<p class="lh">The insulation on the wires of an extension

light that Edward Flasch, one of the

repair men was using became cracked, the

wire grounding as a result. The sparks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
fell into a bucket of gasolene standing

nearby and in a few minutes the entire

building was ablaze. G. W. Smith, proprietor

of the garage, said that he was sitting

in his office at the time of the explosion

and tried to put the fire out with sand

but could not get the blaze under any control.

He then started to run out as many

machines as possible.</p>


<p class="lh">Six cars, valued at $9,000 were saved.</p>


<hr class="hr6" />

<p class="c nt nb lh"><big>IV</big></p>

<p class="lh">Madison, September 25th, 1912; With

a loud deafening roar that violently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
aroused hundreds from their beds of slumber

the monster gas holder occuppying

the southwest corner of South Blount and

Main Streets at the gasplant of the Madison

Gas and Electric Company collapsed

very suddenly at 6:sO a. m. this morning,

and now lies partly submerged in water,

a total wreck. The damage will be fully

25,000 dollars, but there will be no interruption

to the service the company's excellent

reserve equippment being immediately

brought into action for the emergency.

The cause of the explosion was at first

clothed in deep mystery before the officials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of the company had time to make any investigation.</p>


<p class="lh">However it was definitely ascertained

during the morning when Mr. John W.

Jackson, the secretary and treasurer of the

company, being interviewed by a Daily

News correspondent this morning, stated

that the immense quantities of snow on

the roof of the holder was primarily responsible.

The weight of the snow on

one side of the holder causing it to drop

down broke the wheel and pushed the

holder off the foundation on which it was

standing. There was a momentary blaze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
but when the tank settled down into the

reservoir below the fire went out and the

awful peril from this highly dangerous

source was fortunately averted.</p>


<p class="lh">As it was dozens of windows at the

planing mill on the opposite side of the

street were all left intact. In fact no damage

whatsoever outside of the holder resulted

from the unfortunate accident.

Two workmen, Jacob Casey and Nelson

Jones, were unfortunately caught beneath

the wreckage and their bodies were

removed later in the morning by the fire

department. The tank was full when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
collapsed and that it did not scatter destruction

and take more innocent lives

was one of the fortunate features of the

accident and a great cause for congratulation

among the officials of the company

today.</p>


<p>(This story illustrates, among other
things, excessive wordiness.)</p>

<hr class="hr6" />


<p class="c nt nb lh"><big>V</big></p>

<p class="lh">After being chased by a young woman

for several blocks, a man who gave his

name as John Weber, was pursued through

a saloon at 11-97th street by Policeman

Arthur Brown and captured on the roof of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
a building adjoining the saloon, where the

man had hidden behind a chimney. Weber

was arrested by the policeman and is held

on a charge preferred by Charles Young, a

grocer at 2145 Sixth avenue, of attempting

to rob Young's grocery store.</p>


<p class="lh">According to Young, just before he

closed his store for the night last evening,

a young man entered the store and asked

for a pound of butter. "I thought," said

Young, "that the man was just married

and might be a possible new customer. I

started for the back of the store to open a

new tub but just as I turned to go, he hit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
me over the head with his cane. The

blow dazed me but I still had sense enough

to grab him by the collar. In the fight we

both fell through the glass door at the

front of the store and the d&mdash;n rascal got

away." A young woman, who was passing

the store, seeing the fracas, screamed

and started to run after the young man.

She followed him until he ran into a saloon.

Then she ran up to Policeman

Brown, who was standing at the corner of

97th st. and Sixth-av and told him that a

robber had gone into the saloon. The policeman

ran into the saloon, but found the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
man had left by the back stairs. The policeman

followed up two flights of stairs

leading to the roof, on the run, where he

found Weber hiding behind a chimney.

Weber refused to give his address.</p>


<p class="lh">After watching until she saw the robber

taken away in the paddy-wagon, the

doughty young woman disappeared. Her

name is unknown.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />

<p class="c nt nb lh"><big>VI</big></p>

<p class="lh">A burglar dressed in a Salvation Army

uniform was arrested for attempting to

burglarize Walter White's home, 16 West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>

62nd st. at about two o'clock last night.

He gave his name as Julius Woll and his

address as 129 23rd ave.</p>


<p class="lh">The caretaker at Walter White's said

he was awakened at 1 o'clock by the noise

of bureau drawers opening and he at once

phoned to the station. An officer came

and found the would-be burglar under the

bed. After considerable scuffling the man

was arrested and taken to the station.</p>


<p class="lh">The Salvation Army denied any connection

with the prisoner but the landlady at

his address said he had two uniforms and

always wore one. He also carried a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
prayer book under his arm whenever he

left his room. She also said that he had

resided in her house for six weeks and

owed four weeks board; also that he had

not been there for two weeks. Inquiry

proved that he was out regularly until

three or four in the morning.</p>

<p class="lh">The wedding of Mr. James Henry,

1463 Seventh Street, and Miss Sarah

Jones, last night at the home of the bride's

parents, at 316 North Johnson Street, was

a brilliant success.</p>

<p class="lh">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Fifty guests were present and the presents

which they brought all but filled the

parlor. After the ceremony a seven-course

banquet was served until 11:30

o'clock. Miss Sadie Jones rendered "The

Rosary" to the accompaniment of Mr.

John Field.</p>


<p class="lh">The bride wore a gown of pink taffeta

and carried sweet peas. The bridesmaid,

Lily Swenk, was dressed in white muslin.

The groom and best man, Mr. Arthur

Howles, wore conventional black. Rev.

Stone of the First M. E. church officiated.</p>


<p class="lh">The groom is a promising young lawyer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
of this city. His bride is one of the

city's leading young society woman, being

deeply interested in the Womans' Suffrage

League. There marriage is the result

of a love affair begun at the university

and is the cause of heart-felt congratulations

from their friends. After a trip

to the Coast, the happy couple will reside

in this city.</p>

<hr class="hr6" />


<p class="c nt nb lh"><big>VIII</big></p>

<p class="lh">"What we need in our universities are

sportsmen and not sports," said President

G. E. Gilbert of the Western University,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
in the convocation address yesterday afternoon

at four o'clock. "The sportsman

plays for the game, but the sport plays for

the victory."</p>


<p class="lh">The President continued, "Before the

battle, and during the battle, the

sportsman can be told from the sport."

It is the actions of the man, he

said, when he is in the test that determine

to which class he belongs. The President

summarized the various college

activities and showed how the two

classes of men appear in each different

activity. And in each, as the President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
said, "you can tell the sportsman from the

sport."</p>


<p class="lh">"I think that this, the relation between

the sportsman and the sport, is the truest

analogy that can be applied to human life.

Life as a sea, life as a battle, life as a river

in which you must always paddle your

own canoe upstream, life as a hill-climbing

contest&mdash;all these analogies have their

weaknesses. But life as a game is a true

analogy."</p>


<p class="lh">The President concluded with a glowing

tribute to our university.</p>
